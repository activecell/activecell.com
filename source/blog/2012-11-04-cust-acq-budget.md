You already have a customer acquisition plan from step 4, so putting a budget against it should be a manageable thing. The tough part is that the expenses you will incur to acquire customers happen at various stages in the customer acquisition process. With paid search, you typically pay per click, whether that click results in a customer or not. With direct sales, your active sales team might only engage with active leads. With content marketing, you incur expenses up front without even knowing how many impressions that article will yield.

#### Hard costs per channel

In step 1, you have already gone through the process of identifying sales & marketing accounts. Now is a great time to map each account specifically to a channel. If you have an account that spans multiple channels, for now just map it to the channel where most of the costs go (see my pro-tip below about trying to ensure that accounts are granular enough to hit only one channel).

You may have multiple financial accounts that map to a given channel. No problem at all. In the end, you'll have a clear sense of what you've spent per period on each channel in terms of external expenditures.

#### Sales & marketing team costs per channel

But external hard costs are only part of the picture. You need to know how much time your team is spending on sales & marketing (channel by channel, of course!). Multiply that by what you pay your team members, and you can determine your sales & marketing team cost.

We will return to this in step 8 (building a staffing plan), so if you like you can punt on this for the time being and return. Or, if you have 3 salespeople and you know their total comp, use that for now and return to more specific figures later.

Don't forget, your team includes internal employees and external contractors. If you have that SEO contractor you pay $500 per month, add that to the cost of your SEO channel! If you have a PR person who you pay $2,500 per month, add that cost to your PR channel. Or, if you don't have a PR channel, do your best to allocate that cost to the channels where you think he/she is driving the most customers.

#### Unit CAC

If you add your hard costs for a channel for a period to your sales & marketing team costs for a channel for a period and then divide that by the number of new customers acquired in that period, you have unit customer acquisition cost (CAC), a very powerful metric. Now you know what it costs to acquire a single customer, and you know what a customer is worth on average once acquired (LTV) from the last step. Of course, the goal is for LTV to exceed CAC. Once this is the case, you have a scalable business model, because applying more resources to customer acquisition will grow your business, not deplete it.

Just like LTV varies by segment, CAC varies by channel, so as you start to look at individual channels that are performing better than others, unit CAC is one of the most effective methods for making the comparison. What if paid search customers cost $750 to acquire, whereas content marketing customers cost $500 to acquire? If this is the case, you might want to scale back ads a bit and hire a few writers!

#### Customer acquisition cost drivers

Unit CAC is useful for prioritizing channels based on what's working and what is not. But you can't always act operationally on the knowledge that a customer in the content marketing channel costs $750 each to acquire.

The gold mine is determining how much to spend where the spending takes place, and these are described as "cost drivers."

As we said above, with paid search you typically pay per click, whether that click results in a customer or not. With direct sales your active sales team might only engage with active leads. With content marketing you incur expenses up front without even knowing how many impressions that article will yield.

To get down to your key cost drivers, just identify at what stage each account is incurred. Since you already have conversion estimates in place, the rest is arithmetic.

For example, if historically your paid search channel costs $1,000 per customer and you know that channel historically converts at 1% from click to customer, are currently paying $10 per click. Now, you may be thinking, "No, I pay $7 per click!" This is the most valuable part of a complete model. Because, if you are actually paying $7 per click and the numbers don't line up, then clearly your conversion numbers are incorrect. Or your reach numbers might be incorrect. But since the model comes full circle, you know how to calibrate the numbers.

And, by calibrating the historical model, you can feel confidence in tuning your forecast model. That is, you know how much to spend on a single article or a single click. You know how much to spend on an event based on historical conversion. You can quantify the value of holding a meetup. All of a sudden, sales & marketing roi becomes something you can track and quantify because your model is complete.

### Build a customer acquisition budget in a spreadsheet

From this point forward, we take more time to explain the concepts and less time breaking down how to achieve it in a spreadsheet, since the lessons from the previous steps can be applied quite readily to the new concepts.

I don't want to make this sound easy...as your Excel model grows, in inevitably becomes more unwieldy, and I believe the value of switching to Activecell becomes more apparent.

### Build a customer acquisition budget in Activecell

Within Activecell, there are only a few things to do. 

The Account Mapping page in the Channels section allows you to assign individual accounts to specific channels. Please note, it only displays the accounts you already identified as sales & marketing, so you may need to check your general account mappings if you're not seeing an account.

Then, on the same page you need to identify in which stage the cost is incurred so that you can determine how much to spend, given your conversion estimates.

The team section provides the facility to assign your team costs to individual channels, which is something we cover in step 8 (building a staffing plan).

Wow, that was easy, wasn't it? Now you can calibrate the model by looking at unit customer acquisition cost and cost of sales & marketing drivers. I love a well-tuned financial model.

### Advanced steps for the pros

After your first pass, there are a couple pro-tips that may aid the advanced users or that folks that have been up and running on activecell for some time and want to take their analysis to the next level...

#### Ensure financial accounts are channel-specific

Accounts called "Marketing" do you very little good unless you either don't do any marketing or you only do one type. Instead, by aligning your accounts at least as granularly as your customer acquisition channels, you can drive the numbers through much more cleanly.

#### Customer-specific timesheets in the sales process

Timesheets always seem to be a contentious matter. Employees don't like filling them out, and employers notoriously don't do enough with the detail they can provide.

If, however, you spend quite a bit on your sales team and want to make sure they are using their time most effectively, it can be **very** useful to have visibility into how much time they spend pursuing each account. This will also drive salesforce effectiveness metrics, and those are useful not just for you, but for the sales team itself.

All it takes is capturing timesheets with customer detail, and Activecell will take it from there.

#### The multi-channel attribute problem

Some businesses have quite elaborate or complicated customer acquisition cycles that involve multiple "touches" over time to convert a customer. A lead might initiate at an event (channel 1: events) but then reach out to a salesperson (channel 2: direct sales) via the contact form on a very effective marketing website (channel 3: website). During the sales cycle, the salesperson might refer the lead to a handful of case studies and pertinent blog entries (channel 4: content marketing) that build credibility. The the lead disappears until she receives an email (channel 5: email marketing) reminding her to sign up, and she does.

To which channel should this customer be attributed? Obviously in this case there is no simple answer, and ideally it would be *amazing* to be able to log all these touches points and then smartly divide the revenue this customer yields across these handful of channels to accurately "share" the win.

Activecell does not do this.

This problem is a tricky one and requires a much more elaborate platform. If your business has sales cycles like this, you should absolutely check out Marketo or Hubspot, two marketing automation platforms that are all over this problem. Perhaps in the future we may integrate with them so that you can use Activecell for the rest!
