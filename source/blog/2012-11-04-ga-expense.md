You have already planned your cost of goods sold, your customer acquisition budget, and your staffing budget. For most businesses, that represents the lion's share of expenditures, and certainly the sensitive ones. But there are still other overheads and "G&A" (general & administrative) costs to factor in.

Rent comes mind, as do your professional services such as legal and accounting. These should be planned by category based on simple drivers such as revenue and employee count.

### General & administrative cost drivers

In Activecell, the cost drivers for G&A costs are:

* per unit sold
* per active customer
* per employee
* as a percentage of revenue
* fixed (amounts that you set regardless of other data)

For each account mapped to G&A, simply assign a cost driver that models the cost most accurately. A few examples might help:

* Rent is often modeled on a per employee basis
* Legal fees are often fixed and get assigned based on various milestones and events
* Accounting and bookkeeping fees are often fixed and get adjusted over time
* Meals and entertainment expense are sometimes modeled on a per employee basis, sometimes as a percentage of revenue
* The holiday party might be an annual fixed cost

Just like with other cost areas, once you identify the cost driver, Activecell does the rest, calculating your unit expenses so that you can calibrate your model and plan for the future.

Done and done.
