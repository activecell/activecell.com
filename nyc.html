      Right now New York is undergoing a massive expansion of its tech sector, 
      and large companies and startups alike are flocking to the city to be a 
      part of the renaissance.

      Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo are working very hard to create a 
      fantastic environment for companies like ours, and I doff my cap to their 
      efforts, because we have taken advantage of my of the programs and tax 
      credits they have made available. But we also enjoy the less tangible 
      benefits of being in such an exciting city. And of course I am talking 
      about food trucks.
