  Right now New York is undergoing a massive expansion of its tech sector, 
  and large companies and startups alike are flocking to the city to be a 
  part of the renaissance.

  Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Cuomo are working very hard to create a 
  fantastic environment for companies like ours, and I doff my cap to their 
  efforts, because we have taken advantage of my of the programs and tax 
  credits they have made available. But we also enjoy the less tangible 
  benefits of being in such an exciting city. And of course I am talking 
  about food trucks.
