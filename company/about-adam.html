    Adam is the Founder &amp; CEO of Profitably, Inc., the company that makes
    Activecell, the small business management platform. Adam is the lead
    engineer and architect of Activecell and its proprietary supporting
    technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam began building Activecell after nearly a decade consulting with Fortune
    500 CFOs to drive growth and improve profitability. "Most of the time," says
    Neary, "it was just a matter of visibility. Sometimes the simplest questions
    proved toughest to answer. But once you have the data to see what's going on
    clearly, the right path is often obvious."
