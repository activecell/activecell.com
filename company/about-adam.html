    Adam is the Founder &amp; CEO of Profitably, Inc., the company that makes 
    Activecell, the small business management platform. With Activecell, a 
    small business owner can quickly and easily build a dynamic financial plan 
    that connects to their accounting data for historical analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam began building Activecell after nearly a decade consulting with Fortune
    500 CFOs to drive growth and improve profitability. "Most of the time," says 
    Neary, "it was just a matter of visibility. Sometimes the simplest questions 
    proved toughest to answer. But once you have the data to see what's going on 
    clearly, the right path is often obvious."
  </p>
  <p>
    Adam is a "data guy" at heart, at home with quantitative modeling and data 
    management. He has cut his teeth with data optimization, normalization, and 
    categorization algorithms and has written predictive algorithms for a variety 
    of applications. Twice he has helped grow teams from around a dozen people 
    to over 50, so he also has an experienced eye for talent management during 
    periods of high growth.
