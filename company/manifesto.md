## We are here to help small businesses.

There are a lot of things we could be doing with our time. But we are here because we are passionate about helping small businesses. There is something unique and special about building a company out of nothing, and we respect that. "The big guys" have more resources, better tools, and tons of advantages, but we hope we can do our part to level the playing field.

## We aren’t a “charts &amp; graphs” company

People in small businesses are just too busy for traditional business intelligence and analytical platforms. These expensive and unwieldy tools are geared toward large enterprises and take months to set up. We take a different approach. Activecell connects securely to your data, and within minutes you’re on your way with real insights. We take the data plumbing out of the equation and we cut right to the high value stuff so that you can focus running your business.

## We provide the framework

Dashboards and reporting tools are great ways to display data, but they don't provide any structure. With Activecell, you start day one with a library of > 100 thoughtful analyses that directly pertain to small business management. And when it comes to planning, our time-tested Activecell Method provides you a concise checklist and a process to follow that guides you along best practices.

## You really can manage your business with this tool

Most business owners have the instincts to run their business effectively, but they inevitably get bogged down putting out fires and meeting the deadlines of the day. It’s tough to find time to step back and think strategically, and that “critical but non-urgent” list never gets touched. Activecell can help by quickly and easily putting the information you need right at your fingertips. Whether you want that 10,000 ft view or want to drill into the nitty gritty, Activecell can get you there.

## Simple. Intuitive.

Time constraints aside, we haven’t met a lot of business owners who are excited to learn new software suites, and they certainly don’t want to migrate from one platform to another. So we don’t want you to change your current infrastructure. We don’t want you to install anything new. We’ll just show you the insights in a web browser in the simplest, most intuitive way we can. You see something in a chart that you don’t like, click on it to learn more. Care to change the plan? Just drag the value to right place or edit right in the table. Dead simple.

## Black boxes are for airplanes.

Both our numbers and our processes need utter clarity and transparency.

We’ve seen some pretty nice looking data visualizations that look fantastic, but whose numbers don’t really hold up. Or where brilliant statistical inference has drawn conclusions, but it’s impossible to logically follow the analysis from raw data to final conclusion. We call that the black box factor, and we don’t want anything to do with it. It’s your data, and all we’re doing is providing real-time access to it with a simple layer of intelligence added in. The application needs to be utterly clear and transparent wherever categorization, mappings, or allocations are taking place.

## Your business is unique.

You know your business. We don’t. If we sound at all presumptuous, and you feel like saying that we don’t know anything about design firms or running a masonry business or making raspberry preserves, then say so! We agree. But we also know how busy you are. So if we sound a bit know-it-all, it’s just our attempt to anticipate your needs and save you time. If we’re missing the mark, please feel free to email us, call us, or post what you think would get the job done. In the meantime, we tried to make the application as valuable as possible to as many different types of businesses as we can. Long live the differences!

## But also, your business is not unique.

Let’s take our company as an example. We write code for a living, and we like to think we know a lot about that. We are unique in terms of how we built out our team, how frequently we release updates, and how we attack the market. We are so unique, in fact, that we wouldn’t trust someone else's to tell us how to write code better. Naturally!

But we don’t want to be unique in terms of our payroll processes or our cash management “strategy.” There are best practices for all the non-core areas of our business, and the more we can take advantage of what leading companies are doing in these spaces, the more we can focus on our core. The Activecell application, among all its exciting analyses, will make recommendations from time to time, and these recommendations tend to pertain to the non-core areas of your business...where you are not unique.

## We’re in it for the big WOWs, not the feature list.

We have a whiteboard with dozens of features we could add, and some of them will make the roadmap. But we believe that developing a couple really killer features--even if they apply to a narrower subset of the market--means that we can have a more meaningful impact for those customers, and we like that. Small business owners are busy, so building something that makes a few of them say “WOW” is a better strategy for us than trying to be everything to everyone.

## We’d trade it all for happy customers.

We don’t just want satisfied users, we want raving fans. Happy customers are worth their weight in gold. So to build a happy customer base, we’re doing everything we can to make customers happy. Responsive and personal customer support (over email, forums, phone calls, twitter, text messages...however you prefer!). Transparency about the product roadmap and issues that arise. You name it—we want you to check out the product and cry, “Awesome!” If there’s anything we can do to make the product more awesome, let us know (however you prefer).
