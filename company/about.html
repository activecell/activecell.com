---


<p>
  Activecell is the small business management platform.
</p>
<p>
  The product is software offered as a service that helps small businesses
  analyze historical accounting data and build forward-looking financial
  models.
</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
  Once you create your account, you can connect Activecell to your QuickBooks
  or Xero account so that the system can retrieve historical data. No need to
  worry: the system is read-only and does not send changes to your source
  data.
</p>
<p>
  Then, our planning model allows you to ditch your old spreadsheets and plan
  your business online. That means no more ridiculous spreadsheet models
  standing apart from your accounting data. No more manual data entry. Just
  drag the chart values to update your plan. Compare plan to actuals, test
  the impact of complex scenarios in seconds, and share the plan with others.
</p>

<h2>What do I get?</h2>
<p>
  We offer dead simple reporting for all your stakeholders. With just a few
  clicks, put together reports for yourself, your employees, your investors,
  whomever you like. The reports are just as easy to download to edit, or
  ship in pdf format via email right from the platform.
</p>
<p>
  Our dashboards allow you to prioritize the metrics most important to your
  business, and with a library of over 100 analyses close at hand, you will
  have no trouble hand-picking the business drivers that mean the most to
  you. These metrics show up front and center every time you log on, updated
  automatically.
</p>
<p>
  To really dig in, our analysis library puts granular analysis of your
  historical data right at your fingertips. Currently, you have data sitting
  on the shelfâ€¦Why not put it to work? How can it still be so difficult to
  answer the simple questions that drive your business? (hint: it isn't
  anymore.)
</p>
<p>
  Best of all, our platform is lightning fast and dead simple to use. Editable
  and responsive charts and tables make interacting with your data a pleasure
  rather than a chore. Cutting edge browser-based analytics mean no waiting
  for the server for every chart! Fully customizable experience means that you
  see the dashboards and reports you care about most, branded to your business.
  Finally, lightning fast and secure data sync mean that you are always working
  with up to date information.
</p>
<h2>Is this software or consulting?</h2>
<p>
  The product is software and does not a consulting arrangement, though our
  expert network is a great place to start if you are looking for an expert
  to help you get started.
</p>
<p>
  The product is offered in a software-as-a-service model, which means that
  businesses can pay for the software on a monthly or annual basis, and they
  can instantly access the software (and its continuous updates and
  enhancements) online.
</p>
<p>
  The product is also offered in a "white label" arrangement. If you have
  clients or users that would benefit from the platform, but you don't want
  to send them to Activecell because you want to retain the relationship,
  this is no problem at all! We have a branded solution that allows you to
  use your website address, logo, and color scheme (and more advanced
  branding if you like!). This solution is ideal for accountants,
  bookkeepers, and business consultants, as well as technology companies that
  don't want to build out the data connectivity and charting for small
  business applications.
