Once you have planned for costs of goods sold, customer acquisition costs, staffing costs, and other G&A, you should have a complete expense plan which--paired with your revenue plan--represents your complete business model, including net income and burn rate. Pair this up with cash on hand and you can calculate cash runway.

Since you've looked at unit revenue and unit customer acquisition cost already, it should be a small leap to start to think about "fully-loaded" unit economics, or how much profit will you generate per customer after all expenditures are considered. This figure is interesting whether you strip out customer acquisition or not.

At this stage, it can be a lot of fun to play around with the key inputs. How sensitive is my business plan to churn? What happens if I add another revenue stream? Which of my channels should be most profitable? You name it. Now that the model is built, there are no questions you can't answer.

# Bottom up and top-down analysis

Before digging into some of the sexier metrics, now is a great time to calibrate your model based on comparing the bottom-up model (Activecell, built "bottom-up" from key assumptions) with top-down figures like your historical tax returns and your own experience with the business.

Do the numbers like right? This simple "gut check" is half the battle. Do the historical curves match up with the forecast curves? What looks funny? Now's a great time to go back and re-evaluate your key business drivers.

* Do you think you will be able to recruit new employees that fast?
* Can your vendors deliver the raw materials you require at that type of volume?
* Does making that much money 2-3 years out seem reasonable? _and, of course:_
* How did I ever live without Activecell?

# High level metrics

Once you are comfortable with the numbers, let's dig into several high-level metrics.

## Burn rate

Burn rate is a critical figure for businesses that are not yet cash-flow positive. At this point in the process, Activecell can very easily give you a monthly net income value which represents how much money you make or lose in a given period on an accrual basis.

Depending on your business, however, this may not translate into the cash impact of those expenditures. Expenses paid in cash happen right away, whereas expenses paid on credit may impact cash next month. Similarly, customers generating revenue this month may generate cash next month. Not all of your categories are delayed by a month, however, so coming up with a cash burn rate figure that maps to your plan requires thinking this through a bit.

The Burn Rate analysis in the Company section helps achieve this, albeit with a monthly rather than weekly grain. For cash-strained businesses, it may be necessary to build a 13-week cash flow forecast in Excel until such a feature is built into Activecell, but if monthly visibility is adequate for you, the current functionality should provide everything you need.

## Cash on hand and cash runway

If you use the Account Mapping analysis within the Company section to specify which of your asset accounts should be considered "cash" (as opposed to assets such as receivables or goodwill), you can then use your burn rate forecast with your current cash on hand figures to calculate your cash runway.

For businesses that are not you cash flow positive, this is a *very* important figure to track!

## Profitability

With your plan in place, all of the company-wide analyses will be built out for your. You can view historical Profit & Loss and Cash Flow statements in your accounting software, but now you can also generate "pro forma" financial statements that display your forecast in clean and professional ways.

You can also look at profitability, which is simply `profit / revenue`. By definition, 100% is the ceiling for profitability, and it can be helpful to look at this figure per customer and per product.

# What's next?

Now that you have your model in place, the hard part is over. Congratulations! I hope the process wasn't too much of a chore and that it actually helped you think through your business model itself.

But now that it's done, where to from here?

## Keep the model up to date

The good news is, your historical data will continue to refresh automatically. In addition, each model, your forecast figures will roll forward automatically into the new model at the horizon of your forecast.

But that's not everything. As your business inevitably evolves and shifts, keeping your model up to date provides you the best chance of staying on top of the unexpected. You can also model scenarios to test out the impact of key business decisions without throwing off your base plan.

## Prioritize key metrics to help you manage to goals

Now that you have a complete model in place, you will have a more complete view of which factors impact your business the most and which need the most improvement. It's easy to identify 30-40 metrics for a giant scorecard, but that's not useful. How do you know what to prioritize?

Instead, we recommend finding precisely 4 metrics on which to focus at any one time. For your business, it might be churn rate and conversion for the sales channel that are top, with cash runway as a close third. And maybe meals & entertainment expenses have been out of hand for a few months, so you'll be watching those.

The point is, what gets measured gets managed, and by targeting a manageable number of business drivers, you set yourself up for success at moving the needle on them.

## Create custom reports for key stakeholders

Now that your have a complete model in place and have taken the time to clean up your data a bit, getting that information into the hands of your key stakeholders shouldn't be a chore.

Make no mistake, you are your top stakeholder. Therefore, identifying the reports that provide you the information you need most should be your top priority, and automating the generation of those reports is a must. If you have the information you need to run your business without any effort on a daily or weekly basis, you'll look at the reports more often, and what gets measured gets managed.

Then, think through your other stakeholders, including internal employees, customers perhaps, investors if appropriate, board members, lenders who require periodic updates, etc. It's easy enough to automate those reports so they have what they needs, as well. Again, once you set it up, you're good.
