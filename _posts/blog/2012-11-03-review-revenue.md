Once you have grouped your revenue into streams and grouped your customers into channel and segments, you are ready to plan for your future revenue. There is no more categorization to do. At this stage it's just a matter of running the numbers through.

1. By forecasting reach and conversion for your channels, you will know how many new customers to expect
2. By forecasting channel/segment mix, you will know what type of customers to expect
3. By forecasting churn for your segments, you will have a valuable and realistic customer volume forecast
4. By forecasting unit revenue for your segments by revenue stream, you will complete your revenue forecast

#### Customer lifetime value (LTV)

Finally, once your revenue plan is complete, you are able to calculate one of the most powerful metrics in the known universe: customer lifetime value (LTV). LTV is simply the amount of revenue, on average, that you can reasonably expect from a single customer. LTV is calculated as `(unit revenue per period)/(churn rate per period)`

Taking an example, if you churn 10% of your customers each month and each customer yields $500 per month, LTV is $5,000 (because you can expect your average customer to stay for 10 months).

Because unit revenue and churn are both segment-specific figures, this number will be different for each segment.

### The revenue plan in a spreadsheet

For decades Excel has been the place where business plans and financial models live. As a former management consultant, I witnessed first hand the machismo that comes with a "nasty" Excel model, a gargantuan 14-sheet monstrosity that--despite its unwieldy size--yielded impressive insights for so primitive a tool.

I was not alone.

There are tons of "Excel jockeys" out there who can build a great model, but whether you are that person or not, this part of the process can be anything from an unpleasant chore to a total nightmare.

#### The "keep it simple" myth

This is when you tend to hear "keep it simple" as sage advice, and the origin of this advice is the sober knowledge that most people will get frustrated trying to build a coherent financial model, so only by simplifying will they get through the process, and something is better than nothing. This is true.

But the reason why so few of these "keep it simple" models get updated six months later (as the business inevitably evolves and shifts) is that they are far too simple to reflect what's going on in the business. Since they don't capture enough of the reality of the business, they cease to be useful for anything other than an anecdotal guiding light, and that's hardly worth the effort.

#### The brain-eating "Zombie" model 

On the other side of the spectrum, some poor managers trudge forward, trying to capture all the complexity in Excel, and the model grows slowly and steadily and tiredlessly, like zombies in Dawn of the Dead. Before long you're a hostage to your own model, holed up in a mall, swiftly running out of food and ammo.

But in all seriousness, I have seen more Excel models that I care to admit where assumptions are strewn amongst 14 different sheets, and even a quick review yields a handful of critical errors in formulas, mis-copied cells that point to the wrong place. It is a real liability.

#### So how should one do it?

Well, naturally I am biased towards a secure, locked in model like Activecell that eliminates the work and prevents these types of errors! But if you must, my best guideline is to keep the plan linear, and create tables for all the interim calculations.

In the case of our revenue plan, make sure your "Conversion" tab ends with a table of new customers per month, channel, and segment. Make sure your churn tab ends with a table of churned customers per month, channel, and segment. Make sure to include a table for customer volume that takes last period's customer volume by channel and segment, adds in new customers, and takes out churned customers, yielding final customer count per period, channel, and segment.

This laborious but organized process is your best defense, if you must build the model in Excel.

Additionally, this is the time to set yourself up for future refresh success by isolating data that you get from sources like web analytics or your accounting software. If you keep those isolated it will be much easier to refresh...well, relatively.

### Reviewing your revenue plan in Activecell

No surprise here, this is where Activecell really hums. It can be a bit of a chore to categorize all your customers into channels and segments, and it certainly can be chore taking a first pass at historical conversion. But once everything is in place, all of your calculations are there for you.

In addition, future refreshes are a breeze. Once you have your model, you have your model.

#### Worrying about the content and not the calculations

At this stage, it's always valuable to compare your revenue forecast to your historical data to make sure the bottom up numbers make sense next to the top down numbers. 

* Do you really think you can triple your sales next year? 
* What would have to change within the key drivers above to achieve that?
* Does this line up with our prior tax returns?
* Have we seen this sort of growth in the past?
* Why do we feel new potential customers will convert at that rate? Are there benchmarks out there?
* Have our customers really churned at that rate in the past?
* Does my customer lifetime value numbers look right?

Once you're happy with the revenue plan, it's time to think about the expenses that will realistically be required to achieve these revenue levels. Let's get to it!
