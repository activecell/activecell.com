You've committed to building a thoughtful and dynamic financial model to plan for where your business is headed. Outstanding. But before we lay a plan for where we are headed, we need to known where we came from.

### Businesses starting from square one

If you are thinking about quitting your day job to launch a new company, you don't have historical data with which to build a baseline. No problem! You can skip this step entirely.

If you have a business with continuous operations but don't have any "data" in a traditional sense because you don't keep very detailed records and don't use accounting software, that's ok, too. Just try to come up with rough estimates based on your experience for the following line items:

1. Revenue
1. Cost of goods sold (direct inputs into products & services sold)
1. Sales & marketing expense
1. Team expenses (both internal payroll and any outside contractors)
1. General & administrative expense

Provided you know how much cash came in from operations and how much cash left, roughly in the above categories, that should be a good start.

### Build a baseline with a spreadsheet

#### Importing data into your spreadsheet

Most accounting software can export reports into your spreadsheet software of choice (and I will say "Excel" if only for brevity here forward, but it could also be Google Spreadsheets or Numbers or what have you). That's the best place to begin when structuring a plan.

Just create a worksheet called "Historical" and drop in the most detailed Profit & Loss Statement ("P&L") available (leaving out summary rows if possible). We recommend starting with a baseline of 3 historical years of data. If your company isn't 3 years old, use whatever data you have available. In our experience, anything older than 3 years is no longer relevant to forward planning. To make the data a bit more manageable, it happens that 3 years in a quarterly view makes for 12 columns of data, which is much easier to work with than 36 columns!

When I say the "most detailed" P&L, I mean to avoid aggregating accounts into groups such as "Revenue" and "Expense" but rather show the detail of all accounts.

#### Re-categorizing accounts

This is because most business' charts of accounts tend to be a bit messy, and you will want to be able to drag them all around. And that's step 2. Once you have your data in the spreadsheet, drag rows around until you have roughly these categories:

1. revenue
1. cost of goods sold (direct inputs into products & services sold)
1. sales & marketing expense
1. team expenses (both internal payroll and any outside contractors)
1. other expenses (general & administrative)

In most charts of accounts, cost of goods will already be all together, but sometimes businesses have a lot of direct expenses (like "Parts") down in "Expense." Similarly, sales & marketing expense may be all over the place, and almost certainly your outside contractors need to be identified and brought together with payroll.

The reason for this manual re-categorization is that when you build a staffing plan, you have tradeoffs between internal and external staff, but the total budget is all together, so we had better get our historical baseline to speak the same language!

#### Check your work

Once you have your data rearranged into coherent categories, it is still important to add them all up to make sure they match what your accounting software says (it's surprising how often this is where the process goes off track!). 

In addition, if you have ready access to you last 3 years' tax returns, perhaps do a one-time double check that your numbers line up with your reported income and expense on the tax side.

### Build a baseline with Activecell

Activecell provides direct connectivity to your accounting software if you use QuickBooks Desktop, QuickBooks Online, or Xero. We are extending Activecell to other platforms, so if yours isn't covered, please vote up your favorite on our product forum, and we will get to it ASAP!

The beauty of this direct connectivity is that--in contrast to the Excel solution above--once you go through this step once, your data is automatically updated every time you log on, and accounts do not have to recategorized every time you want a fresh view into your baseline.

#### Connecting to your data

If you don't have an account with Activecell yet, just go to [www.activecell.com](www.activecell.com) to register, and then navigate to "Data Integrations" in your settings to connect to QuickBooks (as of the writing of this article, we currently bring all new accounts to this page automatically).

Then follow the instructions for connecting you accounting platform:

* [QuickBooks Desktop](www.activecell.com)
* [QuickBooks Online](www.activecell.com)
* [Xero](www.activecell.com)

Once your data is connected once, we will continue to keep Activecell refreshed with your latest data until you disconnect or close your account, so from there you have nothing left to do!

#### Checking your expense accounts

Your accounts come in from your accounting software with some level of intelligence. That is, Assets, Liabilities, and Equity are tagged accordingly, so we don't have to guess. Revenue and Cost of Goods Sold are tagged, as well. 

However, within your expense accounts we don't have any visibility into which represent sales & marketing expense, which represent team expenditures (both internal payroll costs and external contractors), and which represent other general & administrative costs. These distinctions may not be important in your accounting software, but they are crucial for planning.

For your convenience, the Account Mapping page in the Company section allows you to easily drag and drop accounts from the General & Administrative category and into each of these other categories very quickly. You don't have to worry about categorizing individual expenses (what a drag!). Just categorize the accounts, and all historical (and future!) transactions will be handled accordingly. Easy, right?

#### Identifying cogs (even hidden cogs!)

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) include any direct expenses required to deliver a product or service. Since all accounting systems include COGS as an account category, these should be easy to identify.

However, in case you didn't spend weeks debating the nature of your financial accounts when your chart of accounts was established, here's your chance to identify "hidden COGS" accounts that are lying around in amid your general Expense accounts. For companies that deliver software as a service, hosting/server costs are a common example.

If you have goods that you resell, these should be included. If you have contractors whose services you resell, those costs should be included. And obviously (or not), and raw input and physical goods that are built into products you sell should be included.

#### Identifying sales & marketing expenditures

These need to be planned for as part of your customer acquisition strategy and generally scale with your customer acquisition targets. So splitting them out is critical. If you've read ahead, there is no need quite yet for mapping accounts to customer acquisition channels.

The key thing at this point is simply to capture those accounts representing sales & marketing expense, including advertising, paid search, events and conferences, sponsorships, and any marketing materials. If you have a marketing website, costs associated with that should be included.

#### Identifying team expenditures

Most commonly, businesses have groups of accounts right in a row called "Wages & Salaries," and then "Employee Benefits," and then "Payroll Tax" and so forth. Sometimes it is just one general "Payroll Expense" account.

Please note: Sometimes there is an account for payroll administration which represents the fees paid to payroll processing companies and the like. Some would argue this should be excluded from overall payroll because it's a cost that can be addressed under General & Administrative. It's strictly a matter of preference.

In additional to capturing internal payroll categories, also be on the lookout for external team expenditures. These include staff augmentation, outside contractors that work with your team, and temp labor. These accounts should be planned for as a part of the staffing plan, whereas indirect professional services such as accounting and legal fees should be considered General & Administrative (unless you're a law firm and these folks bill your customers!).

#### Identifying general & administrative costs 

All accounts begin in the General & administrative category, so you don't have to "identify" them, as such, but since we have already sifted through the above areas, now is a great time to make sure the nature of all those accounts fits the "indirect" bill. 

These include rent, meals & entertainment, and all manner of professional services, from legal to accounting to human resources and payroll.

### Advanced "pro tips"

After your first pass, there are a couple extra steps that may aid the advanced users or that folks that have been up and running on activecell for some time and want to take their analysis to the next level...

#### Break up your "bulky" accounts

Sometimes businesses have catch-all accounts such as "Marketing" that contain a very broad range of expenditures. If you are not a marketing-intensive business, this may be appropriate, but if you spend quite a bit across 5-6 distinct channels, breaking the accounts into more discrete categories can add visibility to your spend patterns.

An easy check is to review your P&L for "valleys" of accounts with little or no costs in them divided by "peaks" of single accounts with tremendous spend in them. If those accounts have a uniform spend profile (e.g. "Wages") leave them. If they are too general (e.g. "Raw Materials" or "Contractors"), split them up.

#### Ensure your direct customer expenditures are tagged to each customer

If you take a customer out to lunch for sales reasons, make sure when the expense is booked to a sales-related financial account, but QuickBooks allows you to add a customer reference to the record without having it appear as re-billable. Revenue is almost always attributed correctly to customers, but by attributing costs to customers where appropriate, you will instantly improve the accuracy of your profitability analytics. This change happens in your accounting system but flows through to activecell automatically.

#### Ensure your COGS are tagged to each product

This can be tricky, and depending upon your business, may not be useful, but for manufacturing businesses and general contractors, this can be hugely insightful. Just make sure that when an expense is captured, it is tagged to the product it is supporting. This change happens in your accounting system but flows through to activecell automatically.

#### Update your accounting system more frequently

If you are on a monthly cycle, you can update your plan any time, but historical data will only be updated once per month. By updated your accounting system more frequently, you will have more up-to-date information at your fingertips throughout the month.

Note: If you are working with a bookkeeper, this may not result in more billable hours for the month! Most bookkeepers are open to spreading out their work-load over the month, and sometimes it's just a matter of logging on, then downloading and coding new transactions. Just spread, for example, a 5 hour monthly block of bookkeeping into 2 hours the first week and an hour each the other 3 weeks. 

Still not working with a bookkeeper? Get on board--they are a lifesaver at any business size! Plus, it's easy to find a bookkeeper who knows Activecell at [www.activecell.com/experts](www.activecell.com/experts).
