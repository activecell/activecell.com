title: The Activecell Method for business planning
author: Adam Neary
---

I have had the good fortune of working in a consulting capacity over the past decade with businesses in nearly every industry, including pharmaceuticals and healthcare delivery, manufacturing, automotive, distribution and warehousing, financial services, the public sector (state, federal, and international), software/tech, consumer goods, energy...you name it.

More than anything else, it surprised me how similar the needs were for CFOs and business managers in each of these verticals. It turns out that each of our businesses are entirely unique, but the financial planning process doesn't change as dramatically as I would have thought.

As I have gotten to know small businesses (which I define loosely as 1-100 employees) better and better, a "checklist" of sorts has emerged time and again. More importantly, as I get to know business coaches and small business consultants better and better, many of them have discovered the same.

As a result, we have decided to band together and crystalize this checklist into a repeatable process that small businesses can take advantage of. We call it "The Activecell Method," and we hope you find it useful.

# The Activecell Method for business planning

The checklist is short. Just 12 simple items:

1. Build a historical baseline
2. Group your products and services into logical revenue streams
3. Segment your customer base
4. Plan for customer acquisition across multiple channels
5. Review your revenue plan
6. Build a customer acquisition budget
7. Plan for cost of goods sold
8. Build a staffing plan
9. Plan for other expense categories
10. Review your expense plan

Since we are all too busy, we have designed the method to be quick, simple, and iterative. You can take a first pass in an hour or two, and we have built tools to automate the process to make it even faster.

Once you've gotten started, you can always take another pass later to further refine your forecast, incorporate new information, or play around with scenarios to your heart's content.

# 1. Build a historical baseline

To know where you're headed, you need to know where you're coming from. We recommend starting with a baseline of 3 historical years of data. If your company isn't 3 years old, use whatever data you have available. In our experience, anything older than 3 years is no longer relevant to forward planning.

At a minimum, you'll want to have an accurate record of revenue, expense, and income after tax. But to help inform the next steps in the process, it would be better to split up your expenses into:

1. cost of goods sold (direct inputs into products & services sold)
2. team expenses (both internal payroll and any outside contractors)
3. sales & marketing expense
4. other expenses (general & administrative)

When we talk about "loading" historical data, it might be into a tool like activecell, or it might be something like Excel. We like to think activecell makes it a lot easier, but our methodology doesn't require our tools at all.

# 2. Group your products and services into logical revenue streams

It may be the case that your historical baseline for revenue is broken down into 4-5 revenue accounts that cleanly represent your lines of business. If so, great! Those are probably your key revenue streams.

If, however, you have 40+ revenue accounts because your accounting system provides for all sorts of granular reporting, you might want to group those accounts into manageable "revenue streams" for planning. In short, a revenue stream is a "type" of revenue. Perhaps you sell software but also do consulting. Those are definitely two revenue streams. Perhaps you sell products you manufacture but also sell warrantees. Those are separate streams that can and should be modeled separately.

What if you have the opposite issue: just 1 line of detail for all of revenue. Well, if that is because you just do one thing, that's entirely fine! Just call that "General" or "Revenue" and leave well enough alone. If, however, you do lots of different things and just don't have the detail in the historical data, maybe there's an easy way to go back and split out those revenue records into different accounts. Or maybe you just want to create the accounts and capture that detail going forward. No problem.

# 3. Group your customers into segments

Business planning is a customer-driven process. "How many t-shirts do I have to sell to break even?" is the wrong question. The right question is, "To how many customers do I have to sell t-shirts to break even?" (The difference isn't semantic.) Plus, if there are different groups of customers with different buying profiles, the question is, "To how many of each group of customers do I have to sell t-shirts to break even?" These groups are commonly referred to as "segments."

Software companies often have free users, paid users, and premium users (or some such hierarchy). Retailers have loyalty/return customers and walk-ins. People who make pickles have wholesalers they sell to and customers who buy at farmers' markets. We all have segments.

By defining segments that make sense for your business and segmenting your historical customers into these segments, it becomes massively easier to plan for how many customers you expect to service in the future. 

One of the key insights to determine for your segments is "Unit Revenue." How much revenue, for each of your revenue streams, will a single customer yield on average, for each of your customer segments? You can iteratively improve this estimate over time, but the first pass can be pretty quick and dirty.

The other key insight to determine for your segments is "Churn." What percentage of your June customers are still customers in July? For businesses with recurring revenue, no metric is more critical, and it typically can vary widely by segment. Again, a quick and dirty first pass is ok. We'll get more sophisticated later on.

# 4. Plan for customer acquisition across multiple channels

If you determine later that you need 300 active customers to break even, that's all well and good, but from where will those customer come? Hint: your customer acquisition channels. All customers come through one channel or another. Walk-ins for a retailer, or informal word of mouth for a services business are all valid channels. So is direct sales. Paid channels include traditional advertising, paid search, events and conferences, and so on. Modern channels include content marketing (writing articles that will attract customers) and email marketing.

The Activecell Method calls for identifying your business's key channels, then defining reach, conversion, and channel/segment mix.

Reach is the number of potential customers you will reach at the top of your sales funnel. For your business, the top of the funnel might be prospects that convert to leads that convert to customers. Or it might be website visitors who convert to trials who convert to customers. Planning for how many customers will have a touchpoint with your business is critical because it drives the conversation about conversion.

Conversion is the percentage of potential customers that become customers. If you reach 1,000 customers at an event, then convert 200 of them into active leads, and then close 50 of them into customers, your overall conversion rate is 50/1000, or 5%. Depending on your industry or the event, that might be amazing or awful. You know your business best!

Once you plan for the number of customers you will reach (per channel) and how they should convert (per channel), you need to think about the makeup of the customers that will result from that channel. Often times, referrals yield more platinum customers than paid search, for example. We call this channel/segment mix. If you have grouped your historical customers into channels and segments, this is easy to calculate. If you haven't, make a quick and dirty estimate for the model, and then over time you will see how it all shakes out.

# 5. Review your revenue plan

Once you have grouped your revenue into streams and grouped your customers into channel and segments, you are ready to plan for your future revenue.

1. By forecasting reach and conversion for your channels, you will know how many new customers to expect
2. By forecasting channel/segment mix, you will know what type of customers to expect
3. By forecasting churn for your segments, you will have a valuable and realistic customer volume forecast
4. By forecasting unit revenue for your segments by revenue stream, you will complete your revenue forecast

At this stage, it's always valuable to compare your revenue forecast to your historical data to make sure the bottom up numbers make sense next to the top down numbers. Do you really think you can triple your sales next year? What would have to change within the key drivers above?

Once you're happy with the revenue plan, it's time to think about the expenses that will realistically be required to achieve these revenue levels.

# 6. Build a customer acquisition budget

You already have a customer acquisition plan from step 4, so putting a budget against it should be a manageable thing. The tough part is that the expenses you will incur to acquire customers happen at various stages in the customer acquisition process. With paid search, you typically pay per click, whether that click results in a customer or not. With direct sales, your active sales team might only engage with active leads. With content marketing, you incur expenses up front without even knowing how many impressions that article will yield.

As with everything, start simply and then iterate. If you have a historical sense for how much you spent on each channel and how many new customers came from each channel, the process is a lot easier. Just divide out to get unit costs as a starting point.

If you don't have good historical data for this, start bottom up. For paid search, what do you pay (or would you pay) per click for a visitor? Given your conversion estimates, you can calculate the unit customer acquisition cost for that channel. For these hard costs, make sure that you are thinking about which stage in the acquisition process incurs the expense.

Once you have planned hard costs for your customer acquisition budget, you may still have your internal sales team to think about. If any of your channels involve commissions as a percentage of revenue to customers, be sure to account for that. As an advanced step, you may want to plan for salesforce capacity, mapping the number of salespeople on your team to the amount of revenue they should reasonably be able to generate.

# 7. Plan for cost of goods sold

You already have a plan for revenue by revenue stream, so now you need to figure out what direct expenses will be incurred to deliver that revenue, leaving aside customer acquisition and leaving aside your team.

These costs can be incurred for all revenue streams or just for specific revenue streams, and they tend to be "driven" by only a handful of specific quantitative measures known aptly as "cost drivers." You might incur costs per unit sold of a given product. Or you might incur costs per active customer. Some costs are simply fixed and occur over time, while other costs are best estimated as a percentage of revenue.

For planning, it's often best to group expenses into simple categories (which most often map to expense accounts in your accounting process). Then, decided for each category just one cost driver (fixed, % of revenue, $ per customer, $ per product, etc.) to use for planning.

# 8. Build a staffing plan

A staffing plan consists of just three components:

1. How much do you pay each of your types of employees?
2. How many of each type of employee will you need over time?
3. How much will you spend over time on outside contractors to complement your team?

Just like with your plan for cost of goods sold, the number of employees you will need, by type, is often a factor of several drivers (primarily fixed or revenue-driven). You might simply plan to add a CFO next year regardless of revenue, but you might plan to add a salesperson for every $500k in revenue in your plan.

The same goes for your contractors, though your contractors are often grouped into categories that map to specific expense accounts.

It's easy to let this process get out of hand, and over time you could build more and more sophistication into the staffing plan, but the goal is to know how much your team (internal and external) will cost over time.

# 9. Plan for general & administrative costs

You have already planned your customer acquisition budget, your staffing budget, and cost of goods sold. For most businesses, that represents the lion's share of expenditures, but there are still other overheads and "G&A" (general & administrative) costs to factor in. 

Rent comes mind, as do your professional services such as legal and accounting. These should be planned by category based on simple drivers such as revenue and employee count.

# 10. Review your expense plan

Once you have planned for customer acquisition, staffing, cost of goods sold, and other G&A, you should have a complete expense plan which, paired with your revenue plan, let's you look at your complete business model, including net income and burn rate. Pair this up with cash on hand and you can calculate cash runway.

Since you've looked at unit revenue and unit customer acquisition cost already, it should be a small leap to start to think about "fully-loaded" unit economics, or how much profit will you generate per customer after all expenditures are considered. This figure is interesting whether you strip out customer acquisition or not.

At this stage, it can be a lot of fun to play around with the key inputs. How sensitive is my business plan to churn? What happens if I add another revenue stream? Which of my channels should be most profitable? You name it. Now that the model is built, there are no questions you can't answer.

# In Summary

The Activecell Method is a tried and true approach to planning for your business. When paired with the activecell web application, you can automate much of the process and quickly link up to your historical data, but the method can be useful even without the tools.
