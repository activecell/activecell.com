The Activecell Method is a time-tested methodology for business planning. It is a simple, 6-step checklist for building a plan, and it is designed to be an iterative process. That means you will have a working, usable plan in no time, and you can go back through the plan to sharpen the edges in later passes.

## A bit of background

I have had the good fortune of working in a consulting capacity over the past decade with businesses in nearly every industry, including pharmaceuticals and healthcare delivery, manufacturing, automotive, distribution and warehousing, financial services, the public sector (state, federal, and international), software/tech, consumer goods, energy...you name it.

More than anything else, it surprised me how similar the needs were for CFOs and business managers in each of these verticals. It turns out that each of our businesses are entirely unique, but the financial planning process doesn't change as dramatically as I would have thought.

As I have gotten to know small businesses — which I define loosely as 1-100 employees and/or less than $10M in revenue — a "checklist" of sorts has emerged time and again. More importantly, as I get to know business coaches and small business consultants better and better, many of them have discovered the same.

As a result, we have decided to band together and crystalize this checklist into a repeatable process that small businesses can take advantage of. We call it "The Activecell Method," and we hope you find it useful.

## The Activecell Method for business planning

The checklist is short: just 6 simple items.

1. Group your products and services into revenue streams
2. Segment your customer base
3. Plan for customer acquisition across multiple channels
4. Plan for cost of goods sold in categories
5. Build a staffing plan
6. Plan for overheads in categories

Since we are all too busy, we have designed the method to be quick, simple, and iterative. You can take a first pass in an hour or two, and we have built tools to automate the process to make it even faster.

Once you've gotten started, you can always take another pass later to further refine your forecast, incorporate new information, or play around with scenarios to your heart's content.

### First, a note on historical baselines

To know where you're headed, you need to know where you're coming from. We recommend starting with a baseline of 3 years of historical data. If your company isn't 3 years old, use whatever data you have available. In our experience, anything older than 3 years is no longer relevant to forward planning.

As we go through each step in the process, you will want to have an accurate record of revenue and expense in each account in your chart of accounts so that when you group these accounts into useful categories, you have an aggregate frame of reference for the past.

Naturally, we believe the easiest way to manage this process is with Activecell (click to get started today!), though it can also be done in a spreadsheet.

_And, with no further ado…_ The Activecell Method.

### 1. Group your products and services into logical revenue streams

It may be the case that your historical baseline for revenue is broken down into 4-5 revenue accounts that cleanly and succinctly represent your lines of business. If so, fantastic. Those are probably your revenue streams.

If, however, you have 40+ revenue accounts because your accounting system provides for all sorts of granular reporting, you might want to group those accounts into manageable "revenue streams" for planning.

In short, a revenue stream is a "type" of category of revenue. Perhaps you sell software but also do consulting. Those are certainly two revenue streams. Perhaps you sell products you manufacture but also sell warrantees. Those are separate streams that can be modeled separately. By grouping granular revenue accounts into streams, you make the planning process more manageable.

But, what if you have the opposite issue: just 1 line of detail for all revenue? Well, if this is because you just do one thing, this is fine. Just call that "General" or "Revenue" and leave well enough alone. If, however, you do lots of different things and just don't have the detail in your historical data, perhaps there is an easy way to go back and split out those revenue records into different accounts. Or, perhaps you just want to create the accounts and capture that detail going forward.

* Historical customer revenue

### 2. Segment your customer base

Business planning is a customer-driven process. "How many t-shirts do I have to sell to break even?" is the wrong question. The right question is, "How many t-shirt buying customers do I need to break even?" More, if you have different groups of customers with varying buying profiles, the question becomes, "How many of each group of customers do I need to break even?" These groups are commonly referred to as "segments."

As an example, software businesses often have free users, paid users, and premium users (or some such hierarchy). Retailers have loyalty/return customers and walk-ins. People who make pickles have wholesalers they sell to and customers who buy at farmers' markets. Most businesses have segments of some sort.

By defining segments that make sense for your business and grouping your historical customers into these segments, it becomes much easier to plan for how many customers you expect to serve in the future.

For planning purposes, you might simply set targets for each segment, or if you are able to count the number of customers in each segment, you can track this figure along with a "Unit Revenue" target. Put simply, unit revenue is concerned with how much revenue a single customer will yield on average. This can be calculated for for each of your customer segments.

_Note:_ You can iteratively improve this estimate over time, but the first pass can be pretty quick and dirty.

* Historical customer revenue
* Building a revenue forecast

### 3. Plan for customer acquisition across multiple channels

If you determine that you need 300 active customers to break even, that's all well and good, but where will you find those customers? Each unique source of new customers is called a channel, and all new customers arrive from one "channel" or another. For example, walk-ins for a retailer or informal word of mouth for a services business both count as channels. Direct sales is a channel. Paid channels include traditional advertising, paid search, events and conferences, and so on. Modern channels include content marketing (writing articles that will attract customers) and email marketing.

By defining channels that make sense for your business and grouping expense accounts into channels, it is easy to see what you are spending each month per channel. Combine that with the number of new customers from each channel, and you can calculate "Unit Customer Acquisition Cost" (CAC), which is the average cost of 1 new customer in that channel (a very useful piece of information).

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. For planning purposes, you might simply set a budget for each channel and track to that. Or, if you have access to data on new customers per channel, you can use new customer count as a "driver" for your customer acquisition budget, and you can plan for new customers and unit CAC at once.

* Historical customer acquisition spend
* Building a customer acquisition budget

### 4. Plan for cost of goods sold in categories

Having already built a plan for revenue, now you need to figure out what direct expenses will be incurred to deliver that revenue, leaving aside customer acquisition and leaving aside your team.

These costs tend to be driven by only a handful of specific quantitative measures known aptly as "cost drivers." You might incur costs per active customer. Some costs are simply fixed and occur over time, while other costs are best estimated as a percentage of revenue.

For planning purposes, it is easier to manage the process by grouping expenses into simple categories (which most often map to one or more expense accounts) Then, you might set a budget for each COGS category and track to that. Or, it can be more useful to determine for each category a suitable cost driver (fixed, % of revenue, or $ per customer) to benchmark against for planning.

* Historical cost of goods sold
* Building a cost of goods sold budget

### 5. Build a staffing plan

A robust staffing plan consists of three components:

1. How much do you pay each of your types of employees?
2. How many of each type of employee will you need over time?
3. How much will you spend over time on outside contractors to complement your team?

Just like with your plan for cost of goods sold, the number of employees you will need, by type, is often a factor of several drivers (primarily fixed or revenue-driven). You might simply plan to add a CFO next year regardless of revenue, but you might plan to add a salesperson for every $500k in revenue in your plan.

The same goes for your contractors, though your contractors are often grouped into categories that map to specific expense accounts.

It's easy to let this process get out of hand, and over time you could build more and more sophistication into the staffing plan, but the goal is to know how much your team (internal and external) will cost over time.

As with our previous steps, a first pass at a staffing plan might involve 1-line budgets for each type of employee or contractor in the plan. Or, by looking at the number of employees or contractor in each type, you can building a more granular staffing plan that will also help with hiring plans.

* Historical team costs
* Building a staffing plan

### 6. Plan for overheads in categories

You have already planned your customer acquisition budget, your staffing budget, and cost of goods sold. For most businesses, that represents the lion's share of expenditures, but there are still other overheads and "G&A" (general & administrative) costs to factor in.

Rent comes mind, as do your professional services such as legal and accounting. These should be planned by category based on simple drivers such as revenue and customer or employee count if available.

For step by step guidance on tackling this with Activecell:

* Historical overhead costs
* Building a budget for overheads

## Tying it all together

Once you have a plan for customer acquisition, staffing, cost of goods sold, and overheads, you have a robust and complete expense plan which — paired with your revenue plan — gives you a complete business model, including net income and burn rate. Pair this with your cash on hand and you can calculate cash runway.

If you have looked at unit revenue and unit customer acquisition cost already, it is a small leap to start thinking about "fully-loaded" unit economics, or how much profit will you generate per customer after all expenditures are considered? This figure is interesting whether you strip out customer acquisition or not.

At this stage, it can be a lot of fun to play around with the key inputs. How sensitive is my business plan to changes in the timing of customer payments? What happens if I add another revenue stream? Which of my channels should be most profitable? You name it. Now that the model is built, there are no questions you can't answer.

* Cash planning
* Profit and loss analysis

### In summary

The Activecell Method is a tried and true approach to planning for your business. When paired with the Activecell application, it is possible to automate much of the process and quickly link up to your historical data, build a plan, and track that plan against actuals as they come in.
