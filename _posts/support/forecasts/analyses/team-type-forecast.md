Before tackling the team forecast, be sure to check your historical employee expenditures to make sure agree with how the history looks. Not only will you want to be comfortable with [expense by employee](boom), but also with your [employee type list]() and [historical spend by employee type]().

## Viewing all employee types at once

Sometimes it can be useful to see the big picture by viewing all employee types at once.

### Stacked column perspective

The stacked column chart is great for visualizing how all of your employee types "stack up" to build a total view of your staffing expense.

This means that the top of the chart represents total staffing expense, and you can quickly visualize the breakdown among your various employee types and how that breakdown changes over time.

### Grouped column perspective

By grouping the columns rather than stacking them, it is easier to compare employee types side by side over time.

### Editing plan data.

Historical data is shown with a darker shade, while plan data is shown with a lighter shade. Historical data cannot be edited, as it comes directly from your accounting system.

Naturally, however, plan data is editable, and we have tried to make editing your plan as easy as possible with [interactive charts]() and [interactive tables](). Simply drag plan values in charts or edit plan values in tables.

If you want to tackle a larger period of time at once, you can always zoom out the date range for the analysis and edit entire quarters or years in one edit.

## Viewing one employee type at a time

To view a single employee type, just click on the employee type's name.

This view provides much greater visibility into plan vs actual by showing blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.

This view also provides a very useful feature called "cost drivers." Once you identify a cost driver that is specific to this employee type, it is possible to relate the forecast to useful benchmarks such as revenue, customer count, or employee count.

### Cost driver: Exclude this employee type from the plan

If you have a marginal employee type that doesn't warrant planning, you can always exclude it from the plan entirely.

Any actuals that show up in this employee type will show as a variance, but if it's not a big deal, sometimes excluding an employee type can help simplify a plan.

### Cost driver: Forecast this employee type manually

If there isn't a useful benchmark for planning this employee type's expense, you can always plan it manually.

This means there will not be a cost driver line in the chart, but you can track plan vs actual.

### Cost driver: Forecast top down as a % of revenue

Some employee types lend themselves to planning as a percentage of revenue.

For example, rather than planning for the number of salespeople you might need, you may choose to plan that a particular percentage of revenue will go to salesperson compensation.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by customer count

Sometimes, a portion of a staffing plan will involve planning based on the number of customers you have. As an example, this may apply to account management.

In such a case, you can model staffing costs benchmarked against customer count.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve customer counts from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for customer count must be manually entered in the customer section.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by employee count

Most commonly, a staffing plan will involve planning for the number of employees you will require — by employee type — and what you will pay each employee monthly in total comp.

This works both for internal employees and external contractors.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve employee counts from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for employee count must be manually entered. In addition, other areas of the plan may rely on employee count as a cost driver, so if this is the case, it is critical that plan and actual values be maintained to keep the model in good shape.
