Before tackling the overheads forecast, be sure to check your historical overheads expenditures to make sure agree with how the history looks. Not only will you want to be comfortable with [expense by vendor](boom), but also with your [overhead category list]() and [historical spend by overhead category]().

## Viewing all overhead categories at once

Sometimes it can be useful to see the big picture by viewing all overhead categories at once.

### Stacked column perspective

The stacked column chart is great for visualizing how all of your overhead categories "stack up" to build a total view of overheads expense.

This means that the top of the chart represents total overheads expense, and you can quickly visualize the breakdown among your various categories and how that breakdown changes over time.

### Grouped column perspective

By grouping the columns rather than stacking them, it is easier to compare overhead categories side by side over time.

### Editing plan data.

Historical data is shown with a darker shade, while plan data is shown with a lighter shade. Historical data cannot be edited, as it comes directly from your accounting system.

Naturally, however, plan data is editable, and we have tried to make editing your plan as easy as possible with [interactive charts]() and [interactive tables](). Simply drag plan values in charts or edit plan values in tables.

If you want to tackle a larger period of time at once, you can always zoom out the date range for the analysis and edit entire quarters or years in one edit.

## Viewing one overhead category at a time

To view a single overhead category, just click on the category's name.

This view provides much greater visibility into plan vs actual by showing blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.

This view also provides a very useful feature called "cost drivers." Once you identify a cost driver that is specific to this category, it is possible to relate the forecast to useful benchmarks such as revenue, customer count, or employee count.

### Cost driver: Exclude this category from the plan

If you have a marginal category that doesn't warrant planning, you can always exclude it from the plan entirely.

Any actuals that show up in this category will show as a variance, but if it's not a big deal, sometimes excluding an category can help simplify a plan.

### Cost driver: Forecast this category manually

If there isn't a useful benchmark for planning this category's expense, you can always plan it manually.

This means there will not be a cost driver line in the chart, but you can track plan vs actual.

### Cost driver: Forecast top down as a % of revenue

Some categories lend themselves to planning as a percentage of revenue.

For example, rather pegging legal expense to revenue saves you from having to adjust legal expense forecasts as your revenue forecast shifts.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by customer count

Sometimes, a category will involve planning based on the number of customers you have. As an example, this may apply to a customer entertainment budget if that isn't considered part of customer acquisition.

In such a case, you can model a category benchmarked against customer count.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve customer counts from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for customer count must be manually entered in the customer section.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by employee count

Sometimes a category will involve planning based on the number of employees you have.

As an example, you may peg office expense and rent against employee count and use that as a rough proxy as employee levels grow.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve employee counts from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for employee count must be manually entered in the team section.
