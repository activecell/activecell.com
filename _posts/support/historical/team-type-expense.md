Before tackling the team forecast, it can be useful to group your employees into types for planning purposes.

<aside>
  <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you just want to put a plan in place for each current and future employee, you can always add an employee "type" for each employee and plan that way. Or, of course, you could do a hybrid, planning a "type" for some employees and grouping others into types. This model is infinitely flexible in that respect.

## Employee "types" and the Employee Type List

Employee "types" is a vague term, but every company has unique needs, so perhaps a vague term is best. In short, an employee "type" is simply a grouping of employees that is useful for planning. It could refer to departments, roles, or both. The important thing is that each employee type will be associated with either:

* Cost of Goods Sold (Direct labor)
* Customer Acquisition (Sales, marketing, and similar functions)
* Overheads (Executive, R&D, etc.)

Here you can see a list of your employee types with the list of employees underneath. You can add, rename, and delete employee types however you like until you get to a grouping that makes sense for your business.

### Contractors on the team

Within the COGS, Customer Acquisition, and Overheads section, it is possible to tag particular vendors as contractors so that they are managed through the team forecast.

If you have tagged any vendors as contractors, their costs will appear with the other employees in this list.

Naturally, from this view you can un-tag contractors from here, and their costs will roll back where they came from.

### Associating employee types with COGS, Customer Acquisition, and Overheads

It can be very useful to assign employee types to Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Customer Acquisition, and Overheads. If you do so, your high-level reporting will include both people costs and non-people costs.

### No employee listed records

As we noted in the employee history page, we also include in this list staffing expense with no employee listed, and we include those by account.

As a result, you can capture (for example) accounts for R&D contractors and map them to an employee type you create called "R&D Contractor" and include it in Overheads. Or, you might have an account set up for salesperson compensation. If the expenses in this account do not have employees associated with them, you can take the entire account into an employee type you create called "Salesperson comp" and include it in Customer Acquisition.

## Viewing historical expenditures by employee type

In the employee type section, historical data is shown right in line with forecast data.
