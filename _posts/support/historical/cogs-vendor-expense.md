Activecell makes it easy to look at historical Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by vendor. We provide 5 different perspectives so that it is easy to visualize your data however you find most useful.

### Leaderboard perspective

The leaderboard is a great way to look at total COGS by vendor for a range of time.

The chart shows vendors ranked vertically by total expense, and you can see the percentage of total expense in the line below the vendor's name. As you adjust the date range for the analysis, you will see the values change in real time.

### Lines perspective

A traditional line chart is an easy way to compare vendor cost over time side by side.

### Stacked columns perspective

The stacked column chart is great for visualizing how all of your vendors "stack up" to build a total view of COGS.

This means that the top of the chart represents total COGS, and you can quickly visualize the breakdown among your various vendors and how that breakdown changes over time.

### Grouped columns perspective

While the stacked chart lets you see the cumulative expense across all vendors, the traditional time series makes it easier to compare vendors side by side over time.

### Pareto chart perspective

The pareto chart is a perennial favorite for management consultants (we couldn't help ourselves!). The chart is similar to the leaderboard, showing columns for your top vendors in descending order. The line that passes over the top of the columns is the cumulative percent of total spend.

This cumulative percent line makes it easy to identify which vendors make up 80% of COGS, for example.

### The table

The table below the charts shows the time series data for each vendor along with a total row and total column to make digging through the data very easy.

As you adjust the date range for the analysis, the table will adjust in real time, aggregating data dynamically as required. In short, if you select the time period you want to understand better, the table will adjust to show you that data in a way that is most useful.

## The vendor list and tagging contractors

By clicking "Vendor list" you can view a complete list of vendors. From this list, you can tag vendors as contractors if you want to manage their expenses as part of the staffing plan.

_Note: This distinction has nothing to do with W2 vs 1099 reporting or external accounting requirements. This is merely to aid in building a staffing plan when work could either be performed by internal employees or external contractors._

## Improving on "Garbage in, garbage out"

Of course, the charts and table are only as good as the data coming in. We try to account for potential data problems so that you don't have to manipulate your source data if you don't need to.

### Identifying COGS accounts

The first problem that might cause the charts to show too little data is if COGS accounts have not been tagged accordingly in the [account categorization page](#settings/accounts). By capturing COGS accounts accurately, you can ensure that these charts are populated with the appropriate data. See [this support article](this one) for more guidance.

### "No vendor listed" records

Even if you get the accounts bucketed correctly, COGS data sometimes comes through without specific vendors associated with them. This is less common with bills (most of which have vendors!) but can include manual journal entries or places where vendor data is incomplete.

To help this, we list COGS with no vendor by account. That way, wherever you may be missing vendor-specific data, you at least can see what accounts are registering various amount of expenditure over time.

### Last resort: Update your source data!

As a last resort, if you're just not seeing the level of visibility you would like in your historical vendor data, you may need to ensure that you capture the required level of detail in your accounting data. This is a relatively rare occurrence, as bills are generally captured in accounting data with their vendors, but if this is not the case, improvements to bookkeeping practices will provide a more useful level of detail.

## Viewing a single vendor

To view a single vendor's COGS expense over time, just click on the vendor's name.

This view is much simpler to view if you just want to see that line item.
