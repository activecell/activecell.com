Adam is the Founder &amp; CEO of Profitably, Inc., the company that makes Activecell, the small business management platform. With Activecell, a small business owner can quickly and easily build a dynamic financial plan that connects to their accounting data for historical analysis.

Adam began building Activecell after nearly a decade consulting with Fortune 500 CFOs to drive growth and improve profitability. "Most of the time," says Neary, "it was just a matter of visibility. Sometimes the simplest questions proved toughest to answer. But once you have the data to see what's going on clearly, the right path is often obvious."

Adam is a "data guy" at heart, at home with quantitative modeling and data management. He has cut his teeth with data optimization, normalization, and categorization algorithms and has written predictive algorithms for a variety of applications. Twice he has helped grow teams from around a dozen people to over 50, so he also has an experienced eye for talent management during periods of high growth.
