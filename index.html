            <h3>Plan ahead, stay on track</h3>
            <p>Everyone needs a plan. Just because you're making money doesn't mean you aren't headed for trouble. Profitably's approach to forecasting your business is a bottom-up approach that will allow you to plan for the customers you want.</p>
            <p>We give you templated models to base your company plan on, with the ability to tweak the details to fit your business perfectly.</p>

            <h3>Compare and contrast your customers in one place</h3>
            <p>The success of your business depends on your customers, so you need to know as much about them as possible.  Your accounting software and Excel documents may help you track some of your customer activity.  But Profitably can help you identify trends at a higher level and then drill deeper into each customer's P&L to give you the information you need in a format you can use to help inform your decisions.</p>

            <h3>See employee performance based on costs and activities</h3>
            <p>Gone are the days of 9-5 employees. These days virtual assistants, freelancers and telecommuters are helping to grow your business. Technology has transformed when, where and how work is done. Unfortunately this puts a big strain on the finance team to make sure all the people costs tie out and that you're correctly reporting on contractors versus employees.  People are people, and if they're working for you Profitably can deliver insights into how they're performing.</p>
