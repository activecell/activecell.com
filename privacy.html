        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><span>Maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of information provided by our users is critical to us at Profitably, Inc. ("Profitably"). This Privacy &amp; Security Policy explains how we protect customer data provided through our web application at <a class="linkclass" href="http://www.activecell.com">www.activecell.com</a> ("the Site") and how we use that information in connection with our services offered through the Site (the "Service"). "Customer Data," for purposes of this Policy, means information that identifies you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address; or business data such as employee headcount or historical revenue and expenditures.</span></p>
        <p>Profitably has developed its privacy and security standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your Customer Data. We regularly re-evaluate our privacy and security policies and adapt them as necessary.</p>
        <p> <a name="1"> </a></p>
        <h3>Your privacy is not for sale</h3>
        <p>Simply put, we do not sell or rent your Customer Data to anyone for any reason. Profitably uses and discloses Customer Data only as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to analyze site usage and improve the Site and the Service;</li>
          <li>to deliver to you any administrative notices, alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Site and the Service;</li>
          <li>to fulfill your requests, such as for information, user support, or products and services;</li>
          <li>for our internal market analytics, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</li>
          <li>to third-party contractors, including but not limited to hosting services providers, developers, and security analysts, who provide services to Profitably. We only permit these third parties to use customer data for the purpose of providing services to us, and we require them to maintain the confidentiality of all customer data;</li>
          <li>to enforce Profitably's Terms of Use, and its other contracts and rights; and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy and Security Policy.</li>
          <li>In the event that you access the Site or the Service via one of our co-brand partners, through a co-branded URL, your email address used for registration on the Service may be provided to that co-brand partner. If your email address is provided to a co-brand partner, the co-brand partner may use and disclose the email address in accordance with its own privacy and security policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <a name="2"> </a></p>
        <h3>We limit the collection and use of personal information</h3>
        <p>Certain areas and features of the Site and the Service are available to you without registration or the need to provide to us any personal information. However, other features of the Site or the Service may require registration, which involves provision to Profitably of an email address, a password and your zip code and, to participate on our forum boards, a username (collectively the "Registration Information").</p>
        <p>From time to time, we may request other Customer Data to provide you with other benefits of the Site and the Service. In all such instances, you will be given the opportunity to provide or to decline to provide that information, and it will be used only for the stated purpose.</p>
        <p>Profitably may average or aggregate Customer Data, or otherwise make it anonymous, and may disclose such data only in a non-identifiable manner to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes, such as the number of businesses who switched office supplies vendors or how many users clicked on a particular Profitably Offer;</li>
          <li>Organizations (many non-profit in nature) approved by Profitably that conduct research into business spending; and</li>
          <li>Users of the Service for purposes of comparison of their business situation relative to the broader community.</li>
          <li>Such information does not identify you or your business individually. We restrict access to the Registration Information or other Customer Data you provide, and we use it in accordance with internal procedures and safeguards governing access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <a name="3"> </a></p>
        <h3>Profitably does not request or store account credentials (e.g. logins, passwords, et al) from your financial institutions or third-party applications</h3>
        <p>In order to benefit from the full functionality of the Services, you must connect to third-party applications (e.g., accounting software) and modify those applications' settings to provide Profitably with authorization to access data stored within them. This is necessary in order to allow Profitably to securely access data within those applications. Any data retrieved by Profitably from these applications will be treated as Customer Data in accordance with this Privacy and Security Policy.</p>
        <p>Neither Profitably nor its employees will ever request user names or passwords to your third-party applications. No user names or passwords are stored within Profitably databases or other systems.</p>
        <p> <a name="4"> </a></p>
        <h3>Customer-administered user access to customer data</h3>
        <p>Profitably employees do not have access to your Customer Data except as set forth in this Privacy and Security Policy.</p>
        <p>As a user, you may choose to grant access to your Customer Data to other users within or outside your organization. This user provisioning is a feature within the Account Settings of the Service, and access may be granted to individuals, or revoked, by you at any time.</p>
        <p>This access may be granted to employees of your organization or to outside resources (e.g. your accountant). Additionally, in order to receive value-add consulting advice or to enhance and enrich experiences with our support staff, you may also authorize specific Profitably employees (internal consulting staff or support staff) by name to access your Customer Data at your discretion.</p>
        <p>For privacy and security reasons, you may not grant access to all Profitably employees or groups of employees. You may at any time discontinue access to any users to whom you have granted access.</p>
        <p> <a name="5"> </a></p>
        <h3>Changes to your Registration Information</h3>
        <p>You may update your Registration Information at any time by visiting your Account Settings page while logged in to the Service.</p>
        <p> <a name="6"> </a></p>
        <h3>Online session information and use is only used to improve your experience</h3>
        <p>When you visit Profitably.com, we may collect various types of non-personally identifiable information. The non-personally identifiable information we collect includes technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Site. This non-personally identifiable information is used for various purposes, such as to help prevent fraud, to detect and alert you to software compatibility issues, or to improve our Site's design and functionality. We may collect these types of data using cookies, "Web beacons," and other technologies.</p>
        <p>"Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. Profitably may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store non-personally identifiable information about you and your use of our Site and our Services. Profitably may gather information about your use of the Site and the Service through cookie technology. For example, Profitably may assign a cookie to your Web browser, to limit the amount of times you see a particular Profitably offer while using that browser or to help better determine which Profitably Offers or other content to serve to you. Please note that most Web browsers will allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete cookies stored on your computer. If you choose to eliminate cookies, the full functionality of the Service may be impaired for you.</p>
        <p>Web beacons are images embedded in a Web page or email for the purpose of measuring and analyzing site usage and activity. Profitably, or third party service providers acting on our behalf, may use Web beacons to help us analyze Site usage and improve the Service.</p>
        <p>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities. For example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online campaigns or analyze visitor activity on Profitably.com. We may permit these service providers to use cookies and other technologies to perform these services for Profitably. We do not share any Customer Data with these third party service providers, and these service providers do not collect any personally identifiable information on our behalf.</p>
        <p> <a name="7"> </a></p>
        <h3>Third parties offering other products or services will not be given your customer data without your permission</h3>
        <p>There are a number of separate products and services offered by third parties advertised by us on our Site and through the Service that may be complementary to your use of Profitably.com, such as low cost vendors for purchases, sales coaches, lenders, and other service providers (collectively, "Profitably Offers"). In many cases, we have negotiated pre-arranged deals for Profitably users. If you choose to use these separate products or services, disclose information to the third-party providers, or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy and security policies. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. Profitably is not responsible for their privacy or security practices. If you click on a link to a third party site, Profitably encourages you to check the privacy and security policy of that site. Profitably may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed and whether any action has been taken on a third party Web site. We use this information to improve the quality of the Profitably Offers and customized content on the Service.</p>
        <p> <a name="8"> </a></p>
        <h3>Blogs and other Forums on Profitably.com</h3>
        <p>If you use a public bulletin board, blog, chat room or other public forum on our Site or our Service, you should be aware that any information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. These public forums can be accessed by users not logged onto Profitably. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. These forums may be hosted by Profitably or by one of our third party service providers on Profitably's behalf.</p>
        <p> <a name="9"> </a></p>
        <h3>Contests, Giveaways and Surveys</h3>
        <p>From time to time, Profitably may offer you the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other promotions. Any information submitted in connection with such activities will be treated in accordance with this Privacy and Security Policy, except as specifically set forth in the rules for those contests, giveaways or promotions. From time to time, Profitably may also ask you to participate in surveys designed to help Profitably improve the Site and the Service. Any information provided to Profitably in connection with any survey will be used only in relation to that survey and as elsewhere set forth in this Policy.</p>
        <p> <a name="10"> </a></p>
        <h3>Customer Feedback and Customer Testimonials</h3>
        <p>The Profitably team loves feedback of all kinds, and we encourage you as our user to provide positive and negative feedback as frequently as you would like. We respect the privacy of your feedback and will not post any feedback to our site without your authorization.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Profitably team is always looking for positive customer testimonials. If you appreciate our Service and would like to provide us that feedback, please do not hesitate. We may from time to time ask customers providing positive customer testimonials if we may post the testimonial to our site or use the quotation in other marketing contexts.</p>
        <p> <a name="11"> </a></p>
        <h3>Disclosure of your information to protect our rights or to comply with the law</h3>
        <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Profitably reserves the right (and you authorize Profitably) to share or disclose your Customer Data when Profitably determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of such information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>is necessary or appropriate to protect our property and enforce our rights against you, and to protect the property and safety of others (including but not limited to in connection with a breach by you of this Privacy and Security Policy or the Profitably.com Terms of Use);</li>
          <li>is necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud, or other prohibited or illegal activities; or</li>
          <li>may be required by any applicable law, rule regulation, subpoena or other legal process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <a name="12"> </a></p>
        <h3>Your data may be transferred upon change of control but only in accordance with this Policy</h3>
        <p>Customer Data may be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization or other change of control of Profitably or of all or part of its business. If we sell, merge or transfer Profitably.com or any part of our business, part of the sale may include your Customer Data. If so, we will use reasonable efforts to inform you of the change, and either we or the successor entity will give you the opportunity to opt out of any use or disclosure of any transferred Customer Data by the successor entity in a manner that is materially less restrictive than as set forth in this Privacy and Security Policy.</p>
        <p> <a name="13"> </a></p>
        <h3>You can delete your data</h3>
        <p>We allow you to remove Customer Data anytime you want. When you request us to delete your account for the Service, your Customer Data will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers. However, aggregate data derived from your Customer Data, may remain on our production servers and may be used indefinitely. Your Customer Data may also remain on a backup server or media. Profitably keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers. We also reserve the right to use any aggregated or anonymous data derived from your Customer Data.</p>
        <p> <a name="14"> </a></p>
        <h3>Email communications from us</h3>
        <p>We provide our registered customers with email alerts and periodic reports based on Customer Data and automated Profitably analysis. We also allow users to subscribe to email newsletters and from time to time may transmit emails promoting Profitably or third-party goods or services.</p>
        <p>Profitably subscribers have the ability to opt-out of receiving our promotional emails and to terminate their newsletter subscriptions by following the instructions in the emails. Opting out in this manner will not end transmission of service-related emails, such as email alerts.</p>
        <p> <a name="15"> </a></p>
        <h3>We strive to protect your data</h3>
        <p>We use a combination of firewall barriers, encryption techniques and authentication procedures, among other security measures, in an effort to maintain the security of your online session and to protect Profitably accounts and systems from unauthorized access. Profitably retrieves and transmits Customer Data securely. Our servers are hosted by Heroku, a subsidiary of Salesforce.com, a SAS70 Type II-approved hosting provider with many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating secure large-scale datacenters.</p>
        <p>Although we make good faith efforts to maintain the security of Customer Data, we cannot guarantee that it will remain free from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or alteration. Further, while we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems and network, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent "hackers" or other unauthorized persons from accessing or obtaining this information.</p>
        <p><span>If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Site or the Service, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of our Site and the Service. If a security systems breach occurs, we may post a notice on our homepage (<a class="linkclass" href="http://www.activecell.com">www.activecell.com</a>) and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us.</span></p>
        <p> <a name="16"> </a></p>

        <p>We update this Privacy &amp; Security Policy periodically. The date last revised appears at the top of the Policy. Changes take effect immediately upon posting. If we make an update to this Privacy and Security Policy that is materially less restrictive in our use or disclosure of Customer Data that we collected prior to the update, we will provide you with prior notice of the pending update and seek your consent by posting notice on Profitably.com or by contacting you using the Registration Information you have supplied to us.
