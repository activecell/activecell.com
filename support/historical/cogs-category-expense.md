Before tackling the cost of goods sold (COGS) forecast, it can be useful to group your COGS accounts into categories for planning purposes.

## The COGS Category List

Often, a company's chart of accounts can be much more granular that planning requires. This can be because accounts are split into great detail for particular accounting purposes or because of legacy setups that never got cleaned up.

Regardless of how your chart of accounts looks, you can create categories in Activecell that you want to plan against, and you can roll up any number of accounts into that category.

Here you can see a list of your COGS categories with the list of accounts underneath. You can add, rename, and delete categories however you like until you get to a grouping that makes sense for your business.

**Pro tip:** If you just want to put a plan in place for each COGS account, you can always add a category for each account and plan that way. Or, of course, you could do a hybrid, creating categories for some individual accounts and grouping others into larger categories. This model is infinitely flexible in that respect.

## Viewing historical expenditures by category

In the COGS categories section, historical data is shown right in line with forecast data.
