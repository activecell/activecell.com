Activecell makes it easy to look at historical product revenue. We provide 5 different perspectives so that it is easy to visualize your data however you find most useful.

## What's a "product?"

For businesses that sell services rather than products, please excuse the terminology. When we say "product" we mean "product or service" but wish to be concise.

In your accounting software, products might be "items." Generally, a customer invoice or receipt would include line item detail that would include an account and an item. The item is the product.

### Leaderboard perspective

The leaderboard is a great way to look at total revenue by product for a range of time.

The chart shows products ranked vertically by total revenue, and you can see the percentage of revenue in the line below the product's name. As you adjust the date range for the analysis, you will see the values change in real time.

### Lines perspective

A traditional line chart is an easy way to compare product revenue over time side by side.

### Stacked columns perspective

The stacked column chart is great for visualizing how all of your products "stack up" to build a total view of revenue.

This means that the top of the chart represents total revenue, and you can quickly visualize the breakdown among your various products and how that breakdown changes over time.

### Grouped columns perspective

While the stacked chart lets you see cumulative revenue across all products, the traditional time series makes it easier to compare products side by side over time.

### Pareto chart perspective

The pareto chart is a perennial favorite for management consultants (we couldn't help ourselves!). The chart is similar to the leaderboard, showing columns for your top products in descending order. The line that passes over the top of the columns is the cumulative percent of total revenue.

This cumulative percent line makes it easy to identify which products make up 80% of revenue, for example.

### The table

The table below the charts shows the time series data for each product along with a total row and total column to make digging through the data very easy.

As you adjust the date range for the analysis, the table will adjust in real time, aggregating data dynamically as required. In short, if you select the time period you want to understand better, the table will adjust to show you that data in a way that is most useful.

## Improving on "Garbage in, garbage out"

Of course, the charts and table are only as good as the data coming in. We try to account for potential data problems so that you don't have to manipulate your source data if you don't need to.

### "No product listed" records

Depending on your business, revenue data may come through without specific products associated with them.

To help this, we list revenue with no product by account. That way, wherever you may be missing product-specific data, you at least can see what accounts are registering various amount of revenue over time.

### Businesses that don't track products

If you have a business and you exclusively track customer revenue or revenue by account within recording specific products at all, then this section of the application may not be of much use to you. That may be that!

### Last resort: Update your source data!

As a last resort, if you're just not seeing the level of visibility you would like in your historical product data, you may need to ensure that you capture the required level of detail in your accounting data. This might mean opting into a data integration between your payment processor and your accounting data.

Or, this might mean asking your bookkeeper — if you have one — to manually code sales report data into your accounting software. If you partner with a bookkeeper who can use offshore resources for this data entry, it can cost a fraction of what you might expect.

## Viewing a single product

To view a single product's revenue over time, just click on the product's name.

This view is much simpler to view if you just want to see that line item.
