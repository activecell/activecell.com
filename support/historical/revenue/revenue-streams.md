Before tackling the revenue forecast, it can be useful to group your revenue accounts into revenue streams for planning purposes.

## What's a revenue stream?

A revenue stream is simply a grouping of revenue accounts. It can be useful in planning your revenue forecast to be thinking about the different streams through which revenue is generated without planning for each individual account.

## The Revenue Stream List

Often, a company's chart of accounts can be much more granular that planning requires. This can be because accounts are split into great detail for particular accounting purposes or because of legacy setups that never got cleaned up. We have seen revenue account lists in the hundreds because they provide granular visibility supporting a complex commissions model. This is fine for calculating commissions, but it can be a disaster for revenue planning.

Regardless of how your chart of accounts looks, you can create revenue streams in Activecell that you want to plan against, and you can roll up any number of accounts into each revenue stream.

Here you can see a list of your revenue streams with the list of accounts underneath. You can add, rename, and delete streams however you like until you get to a grouping that makes sense for your business.

**Pro tip:** If you just want to put a plan in place for each revenue account, you can always add a stream for each account and plan that way. Or, of course, you could do a hybrid, creating streams for some individual accounts and grouping others into larger streams. This model is infinitely flexible in that respect.
