title: "Historical customer segment revenue"

Before tackling the revenue forecast, it can be useful to group your customers into segments for planning purposes.

## What's a segment?

Not all customers are created equal! By segmenting your customer base, you can plan for different groups of customers. For software businesses, this might mean free, basic, and upgraded customers. For services businesses, you may distinguish between silver, gold and platinum customers based on annual revenue tiers. It depends upon your business.

## The Segment List

Here you can see a list of your segments with the list of their employees underneath. You can add, rename, and delete segments however you like until you get to a grouping that makes sense for your business.

**Pro tip:** If you just want to put a plan in place for each current and future customer, you can always add a segment for each customer and plan that way. Or, of course, you could do a hybrid, creating segments for some customers and grouping others into larger segments. This model is infinitely flexible in that respect.

### No customer listed records

As we noted in the revenue history page, we also include in this list revenue with no customer listed, and we include those by account.

As a result, you can capture (for example) accounts for cash sales and map them to a customer segment you create called "Cash" and plan for that segment accordingly. This flexibility in the model allows you great flexibility in molding Activecell to your unique business.

## Viewing historical revenue by segment
