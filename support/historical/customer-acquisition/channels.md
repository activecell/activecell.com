Before tackling the customer acquisition (sales & marketing) forecast, it can be useful to group your customer acquisition accounts into channels for planning purposes.

## What's a channel?

A channel is simply a source of customers, such as direct sales, content marketing, email marketing, referral, etc. It can be useful in planning your customer acquisition budget to be thinking about the different channels through which customers are acquired.

## The Channel List

Often, a company's chart of accounts can be much more granular that planning requires. This can be because accounts are split into great detail for particular accounting purposes or because of legacy setups that never got cleaned up. We have seen sales & marketing account lists in the hundreds because they provide granular visibility supporting a complex commissions model. This is fine for calculating commissions, but it can be a disaster for customer acquisition forecasting.

Regardless of how your chart of accounts looks, you can create channels in Activecell that you want to plan against, and you can roll up any number of accounts into each channel.

Here you can see a list of your channels with the list of accounts underneath. You can add, rename, and delete channels however you like until you get to a grouping that makes sense for your business.

**Pro tip:** If you just want to put a plan in place for each customer acquisition account, you can always add a channel for each account and plan that way. Or, of course, you could do a hybrid, creating channels for some individual accounts and grouping others into larger channels. This model is infinitely flexible in that respect.
