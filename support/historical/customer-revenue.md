Activecell makes it easy to look at historical revenue by customer. We provide 5 different perspectives so that it is easy to visualize your data however you find most useful.

### Leaderboard perspective

The leaderboard is a great way to look at total revenue by customer for a range of time.

The chart shows customers ranked vertically by total revenue, and you can see the percentage of revenue in the line below the customer's name. As you adjust the date range for the analysis, you will see the values change in real time.

### Lines perspective

A traditional line chart is an easy way to compare customer revenue over time side by side.

### Stacked columns perspective

The stacked column chart is great for visualizing how all of your customers "stack up" to build a total view of revenue.

This means that the top of the chart represents total revenue, and you can quickly visualize the breakdown among your various customers and how that breakdown changes over time.

### Grouped columns perspective

While the stacked chart lets you see cumulative revenue across all customers, the traditional time series makes it easier to compare customers side by side over time.

### Pareto chart perspective

The pareto chart is a perennial favorite for management consultants (we couldn't help ourselves!). The chart is similar to the leaderboard, showing columns for your top customers in descending order. The line that passes over the top of the columns is the cumulative percent of total revenue.

This cumulative percent line makes it easy to identify which customers make up 80% of revenue, for example.

### The table

The table below the charts shows the time series data for each customer along with a total row and total column to make digging through the data very easy.

As you adjust the date range for the analysis, the table will adjust in real time, aggregating data dynamically as required. In short, if you select the time period you want to understand better, the table will adjust to show you that data in a way that is most useful.

## Improving on "Garbage in, garbage out"

Of course, the charts and table are only as good as the data coming in. We try to account for potential data problems so that you don't have to manipulate your source data if you don't need to.

### "No customer listed" records

Depending on your business, revenue data may come through without specific customers associated with them. This is less common with customer invoices (which of course include customers!) but can include instances where high-level journals entries are included form payment processors.

To help this, we list revenue with no customer by account. That way, wherever you may be missing customer-specific data, you at least can see what accounts are registering various amount of revenue over time.

### Businesses that don't track customers

If you have a retail business and you exclusively track products or revenue by account within recording specific customers, then this section of the application may not be of much use to you. That may be that!

### Last resort: Update your source data!

As a last resort, if you're just not seeing the level of visibility you would like in your historical customer data, you may need to ensure that you capture the required level of detail in your accounting data. This might mean opting into a data integration between your payment processor and your accounting data.

Or, this might mean asking your bookkeeper — if you have one — to manually code sales report data into your accounting software. If you partner with a bookkeeper who can use offshore resources for this data entry, it can cost a fraction of what you might expect.

## Viewing a single customer

To view a single customer's revenue over time, just click on the customer's name.

This view is much simpler to view if you just want to see that line item.
