Before tackling the revenue forecast, it can be useful to group your product into product groups for planning purposes.

## What's a product group?

Many businesses that track individual product sales have a long list of product to manage. Planning for each product can potentially be a nightmare if the list is long. Plus, products come and go over time.

By grouping individual products into groups, it becomes easier to plan future revenue in a manageable way.

## The Product Group List

Here you can see a list of your product groups with the list of their products underneath. You can add, rename, and delete product groups however you like until you get to a grouping that makes sense for your business.

**Pro tip:** If you just want to put a plan in place for each current and future product, you can always add a product group for each product and plan that way. Or, of course, you could do a hybrid, creating specific groups for some products and grouping others into larger groups. This model is infinitely flexible in that respect.

### No product listed records

As we noted in the revenue history page, we also include in this list revenue with no product listed, and we include those by account.

As a result, you can capture (for example) accounts for cash sales and map them to a product group you create called "Cash" and plan for that group accordingly. This flexibility in the model allows you great flexibility in molding Activecell to your unique business.
