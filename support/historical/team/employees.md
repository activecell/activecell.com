Activecell makes it easy to look at historical staffing expenditures. We provide 5 different perspectives so that it is easy to visualize your data however you find most useful.

### Leaderboard perspective

The leaderboard is a great way to look at your total staffing expense by employee for a range of time.

The chart shows employees ranked vertically by total expense, and you can see the percentage of total expense in the line below the employee's name. As you adjust the date range for the analysis, you will see the values change in real time.

### Lines perspective

A traditional line chart is an easy way to compare employee cost over time side by side.

### Stacked columns perspective

The stacked column chart is great for visualizing how all of your employees "stack up" to build a total view of your staffing expense.

This means that the top of the chart represents total staffing expense, and you can quickly visualize the breakdown among your various employees and how that breakdown changes over time.

### Grouped columns perspective

While the stacked chart lets you see the cumulative expense across all employees, the traditional time series makes it easier to compare employees side by side over time.

### Pareto chart perspective

The pareto chart is a perennial favorite for management consultants (we couldn't help ourselves!). The chart is similar to the leaderboard, showing columns for your top employees in descending order. The line that passes over the top of the columns is the cumulative percent of total spend.

This cumulative percent line makes it easy to identify which employees make up 80% of the staffing spend, for example.

### The table

The table below the charts shows the time series data for each employee along with a total row and total column to make digging through the data very easy.

As you adjust the date range for the analysis, the table will adjust in real time, aggregating data dynamically as required. In short, if you select the time period you want to understand better, the table will adjust to show you that data in a way that is most useful.

## Improving on "Garbage in, garbage out"

Of course, the charts and table are only as good as the data coming in. We try to account for potential data problems so that you don't have to manipulate your source data if you don't need to.

### Identifying team-related accounts

The first problem that might cause the charts to show too little data is if team-related accounts have not been tagged accordingly in the [account categorization page](#settings/accounts). By bucketing payroll, benefits, and contractor accounts in the team bucket, you can ensure that these charts are populated with your team data. See [this support article]() for more guidance.

### "No employee listed" records

Even if you get the accounts bucketed correctly, staffing expense data often comes through without specific employees associated with them. It might be that the source data just has lump payments to payroll vendors or that contractor-specific accounts don't have employees associated with their bills.

To help this, we list staffing expenses without employees by account. That way, if you don't have employee-specific data but can map sales staff compensation to a sales payroll account, you can use that account to better understand sales comp over time.

This also means that you can map contractor expense to accounts that give you better visibility into the nature of the expenses.

When you get to building a staffing forecast, you can map these different accounts to employee types whether they have employee-related data or not.

### Last resort: Update your source data!

As a last resort, if you're just not seeing the level of visibility you would like in your historical employee data, you may need to ensure that you capture the required level of detail in your accounting data. This might mean opting into a data integration between your payroll provider (e.g. ADP, Paychex, Insperity) and your accounting data.

Or, this might mean asking your bookkeeper — if you have one — to manually code payroll report data into your accounting software. If you partner with a bookkeeper who can use offshore resources for this data entry, it can cost a fraction of what you might expect.

## Viewing a single employee

To view a single employee's cost over time, just click on the employee's name.

This view is much simpler to view if you just want to see that line item.
