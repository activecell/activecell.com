Intuit offers a single-sign-on (SSO) experience so that being logged into their platform means being logged into Activecell. It's a great convenience, particularly if you use multiple applications that integrate with QuickBooks.

## Creating an Activecell account using your Intuit account

When you visit [http://launchpad.activecell.com](http://launchpad.activecell.com) you will be presented with the following screen:

Simply click "Sign in with Intuit" to get started.

If you are not already signed into your Intuit account, you will be asked to sign in:

_Note: If you do not yet have an Intuit account, you can create one in minutes by clicking "Create an account."_

## Authorizing your company

Once signed in, if you do not yet have an Activecell account, you will be asked to connect to your QuickBooks data. It is during this step that you select which company's data to use. This is particularly important if you have multiple QuickBooks companies associated with your account.

At this point, Activecell will begin extracting 3 years of historical data as a baseline for your planning.

Please see one of the following articles for more information on syncing data:

## What's next?

After your data is retrieved, your free trial begins.

The last step in setting up Activecell is to confirm how we have categorized your chart of accounts. This simply ensures that your data is rolling up to the correct places, and you can always update it later.

See [this article](/categorizing-accounts) for more information on categorizing accounts.
