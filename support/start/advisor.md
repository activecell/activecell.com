If you have read through our materials about our [advisor program]() and want to get started straight away, we want to make getting started with Activecell as quick and easy as possible.

## If you use Activecell for your own company

The easiest way to get started with Activecell as an advisor is to create an account for your own company. If you use QuickBooks or Xero for your own books, you are all set.

See [Getting started with Activecell]() for more information on settings up your own account.

Then, see [Upgrading to advisor]() for information about the advisor program.

## If you do not use Activecell for your own company

Sometimes, we have advisors who want to deliver Activecell to the clients, but they don't use QuickBooks or Xero themselves.

In these cases, steps get set up you will:

1. Create an Activecell account with an email and password
1. Upgrade to advisor
1. Create a company for your first client and invite users

## Create an Activecell account with an email and password

When you visit [http://launchpad.activecell.com](http://launchpad.activecell.com) you will be presented with the following screen:

Simply click "Sign up" to get started.

In the form that follows, please provide an email address, password, and company name. Your company name will be used in the web address for your new account. For example, if your company is named "Sterling Cooper" you might access Activecell at http://sterlingcooper.activecell.com.

## Upgrade to advisor

Typically, this is the screen where users will then connect to their accounting data. However, you can also:

1. Invite other users to your company
2. Upgrade to advisor status

### Inviting other users

If the first company you create is your client's company, you can invite your clients from this screen. If you need your client to connect their data (it requires admin access!), this is a logical approach from here.

Once invited, your client will receive an email asking them to create an account.

They can then connect their data and begin using Activecell.

### Upgrade to advisor status

If the first company you create is your own company, you can upgrade to advisor status from this screen. This will circumvent the need to connect data for your company.

Once you have upgraded your company to advisor status, you can begin adding companies and inviting users.

## Create a company for your first client and invite users

See the following articles for more information:

* [Advisor company management]()
* [Inviting users]()

_Note:_ Be sure to log onto your client's company before inviting other users. You will typically want to invite users to their own company rather than to yours.

Generally, you can create as many companies as you like. After creating a company, simply click "Log on" to that company in order to invite users and connect data.
