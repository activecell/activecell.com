Activecell provides a variety of methods for building a overheads forecast for you business and comparing historical overheads expenditures to the plan.

When you visit the [overheads overview](), you can view total overheads expenditures compared to plan over time, and you can modify the methods by which the forecast is generated.

The point of providing these different methods is to ensure that companies that want a simple, 1-line forecast for overheads can have this, while companies that require a tremendous degree of granularity can have that, as well. Activecell is designed to mold to your business however you think about it.

## Forecast method: Exclude overheads from the plan

It might be the case that your plan involves a negligible amount of overheads and that there is no need to build a plan for them. Of course, this is fine with Activecell. Select "Exclude" to eliminate the overheads forecast entirely. Done and done.

In this case, the table and chart will only show actual data with no plan to compare against.

## Forecast method: Forecast manually: 1 line

It might be the case that you only really have one class of overheads or that overheads are so simple for your business that you don't want to get into building out a list of categories for them. If this is the case, you can select "Forecast manually" to build your overheads forecast in one line.

In such a case, you have a few extra tools at your disposal for getting a single-line forecast right. We call those "cost drivers," and they are the same tools we use to model individual categories.

### Cost driver: Forecast manually

If there isn't a useful benchmark for planning overheads and you really just want a 1-line plan, no problem.

This means there will not be a cost driver line in the chart, but you can still track plan vs actual.

### Cost driver: Forecast top down as a % of revenue

You can benchmark your overheads forecast as a simple percentage of revenue.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by customer count

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your overheads forecast against customer count, presuming that as customer volume grows, so will your overheads.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve customer counts from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for customer count must be manually entered in the customer section.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by employee count

It is also possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your overheads forecast against employee count, presuming that as your team grows, so will your overheads.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve employee counts from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for employee count must be manually entered in the team section.

## Forecast method: Build bottom up by overheads category

In many cases, a business will want granular control over various categories of overheads, and so by selecting "Build bottom up" you defer the forecast to the individual categories you have created. Visit the [Overheads categories]() section to manage individual categories.

In this case, the chart will show blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.
