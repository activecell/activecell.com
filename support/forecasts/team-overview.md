title: "Team forecast overview"

Activecell provides a variety of methods for building a staffing plan for you business and comparing historical team expenditures to the plan.

When you visit the [team overview](), you can view total expenditures compared to plan over time, and you can modify the methods by which the forecast is generated.

The point of providing these different methods is to ensure that companies that want a simple, 1-line forecast for their team can have this, while companies that require a tremendous degree of granularity can have that just the same. Activecell is designed to mold to your business however you think about it.

## Forecast method: Exclude team costs from the plan

It might be the case that your plan involves a negligible amount of staffing costs and that there is no need to build a plan for a team. Of course, this is fine with Activecell. Select "Exclude" to eliminate the team forecast entirely. Done and done.

In this case, the table and chart will only show actual data with no plan to compare against. Any actuals that show up in team cost accounts will show as a variance.

## Forecast method: Forecast manually: 1 line

It might be the case that you only really have one type of employee or that your staffing plan is so simple that you don't want to get into building out a list of employee types. If this is the case, you can select "Forecast manually" to build your staffing plan in one line.

In such a case, you have a few extra tools at your disposal for getting a single-line forecast right. We call these "cost drivers," and they are the same tools we use to model individual employee types.

### Cost driver: Forecast manually

If there isn't a useful benchmark for planning staffing costs and you really just want a 1-line plan, no problem.

This means there will not be a cost driver line in the chart, but you can still track plan vs actual.

### Cost driver: Forecast top down as a % of revenue

You can benchmark your staffing budget as a simple percentage of revenue, and as your revenue forecast evolves, your staff budget will follow it.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by product volume

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your staffing plan against product sales (e.g. for every _x_ thousand units, should spend _y_ on our team).

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve product volume from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for product volume must be managed manually within the [product group forecast]().

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by customer volume

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your entire staffing plan against customer volume, presuming that as customer volume grows, so will your team.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve customer volume from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for customer volume must be managed manually within the [customer segment forecast]().


### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by team size

If you do not wish to model your staffing plan by employee type but still want to track employee count, your staffing plan can include a 1-line forecast for employee count along with what you will pay each employee monthly in total comp on average.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve team size from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for employee count must be managed manually. In addition, other areas of the plan may rely on team size as a cost driver, so if this is the case, it is critical that plan and actual values be maintained to keep the model in good shape.

## Forecast method: Build bottom up by employee type **most common**

In many cases, a business will want granular control over various types of employees. By selecting "Build bottom up" you defer the forecast to the individual employee types you have created.

Then visit the [Employee types]() section to manage individual employee types.

In this case, the chart will show blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.
