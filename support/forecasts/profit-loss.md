The Profit & Loss analysis is the foundation of your plan. In one view, you can see your historical data, your plan, and how the two compare.

## Creating a plan

The first time that you view the Profit & Loss page, your plan will be empty.

From here, you have several options:

### Starting from scratch

If your historical data isn't a particularly useful starting point for forward planning, you can always start from scratch. The plan is empty to begin with, and you can quickly begin filling out the plan manually.

To do so, just select "Start from scratch" to close the alert.

### Roll last month forward

Often times, the best starting point is to take the previous month and simply roll its figures forward. From there you can edit the values to reflect your future plans.

To do so, just select "Use last month" from the alert.

### Roll last year forward

If your business is particularly cyclical, sometimes the best starting point is to take the previous year and simply roll its figures forward on a month-by-month basis. From there you can edit the values to reflect your future plans.

To do so, just select "Use last year" from the alert.

## Updating your plan

We have tried to make updating your plan as painless as possible. You can zoom out and edit entire quarters or years at a time. You can drag values in our interactive charts. You can edit values directly in our interactive tables.

* See this article for help on using our interactive charts to build your plan.

## "Granularity" of each line item

Sometimes all you need for planning is a single line for revenue and a single line for expense. Activecell allows for this type of high-level planning, and we can roll up for revenue and expenses on an ongoing basis to show you how you're doing.

However, most businesses require a more detailed (more "granular") plan. To achieve this simple click on the row heading, and this will take you to the place in Activecell where you can dig into more detail.
