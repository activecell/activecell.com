title: "Profit & Loss analysis"
---

The Profit & Loss analysis is the foundation of your plan. In one view, you can see your historical data, your plan, and how the two compare.

## Creating a plan

If this is your first time viewing the Profit & Loss page, please see [Creating a plan]() for information on getting started.

## Various perspectives on the same data

Throughout Activecell, most pages offer you multiple "perspectives" on the same data. We do this because different folks have different ways they like to consume data and because each business is different.

### Waterfall perspective

The waterfall perspective is the default because it provides a simple view into historical and forecast performance.

The first column shows revenue, and then each of the following four columns show the standard buckets of expenditures (COGS, customer acquisition, team, and overheads). As we note below, if you have assigned your employee types to expense categories, team costs will roll up under them, and there will be no team line item in the waterfall.

In addition, the table will display plan and actual data for all periods selected.

<!-- ### Bullets perspective

The bullet chart is a tricky one, but once you are accustomed to the data it displays, it can be a powerful view into your data. -->

### Variance perspective

Variance analysis takes a simple look at plan vs actual data for the time period selected without attempting to display the data over time.

Blue columns represent actuals, and plan is displayed either as green or as red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.

The table below is simplified to display the same data: actual, plan, and variance.

## Editing plan data

If any of your 5 plan line items are managed as 1-line forecasts, you will be able to edit those lines right in place from the P&L. Naturally, this applies only to plan data, as historical data is taken from your accounting software.

In most cases, however, more granular and complex forecasts are managed within each section of the application, and the P&L report allows you to click on the line item to be taken directly to the section of the application that deals with that line.

In addition, the simple navigation on the left side of Activecell's window provides a shortcut for each section of the P&L.
