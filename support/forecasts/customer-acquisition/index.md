Activecell provides a variety of methods for building a customer acquisition forecast for you business and comparing historical customer acquisition expenditures to the plan.

When you visit the [customer acquisition overview](), you can view total expenditures compared to plan over time, and you can modify the methods by which the forecast is generated.

The point of providing these different methods is to ensure that companies that want a simple, 1-line forecast for customer acquisition can have this, while companies that require a tremendous degree of granularity can have that just the same. Activecell is designed to mold to your business however you think about it.

## Forecast method: Exclude customer acquisition from the plan

It might be the case that your plan involves a negligible amount of customer acquisition expenditures and that there is no need to build a plan for them. Of course, this is fine with Activecell. Select "Exclude" to eliminate the customer acquisition forecast entirely. Done and done.

In this case, the table and chart will only show actual data with no plan to compare against. Any actuals that show up in customer acquisition accounts will show as a variance.

## Forecast method: Forecast manually: 1 line

It might be the case that you only really have one channel or that your customer acquisition model is so simple for your business that you don't want to get into building out a list of channels for it. If this is the case, you can select "Forecast manually" to build your customer acquisition forecast in one line.

In such a case, you have a few extra tools at your disposal for getting a single-line forecast right. We call these "cost drivers," and they are the same tools we use to model individual channels.

### Cost driver: Forecast manually

If there isn't a useful benchmark for planning customer acquisition and you really just want a 1-line plan, no problem.

This means there will not be a cost driver line in the chart, but you can still track plan vs actual.

### Cost driver: Forecast top down as a % of revenue

You can benchmark your customer acquisition forecast as a simple percentage of revenue, and as your revenue forecast evolves, your customer acquisition forecast will follow it.

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by product volume

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your customer acquisition forecast against product sales (e.g. for every _x_ thousand units, customer acquisition should be _y_).

</figure>

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve product volume from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for product volume must be managed manually within the [product group forecast]().

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by customer volume

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your customer acquisition forecast against customer volume, presuming that as customer volume grows, so will your customer acquisition.

**Note:** As a first comment, please note that for now "customer volume" refers to existing customer volume and not new customer volume. In the future, we will be introducing a way to track new customers, existing customers, and churned customers, which will give us much more flexibility in planning. If you need this urgently, let us know!

**Note:** As a second comment, for now Activecell cannot reliably retrieve customer volume from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for customer volume must be managed manually within the [customer segment forecast]().

### Cost driver: Forecast bottom up by team size

It is also possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your customer acquisition forecast against team size, presuming that as your team grows, so will your customer acquisition forecast.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve team size from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for team size must be managed manually within the [employee type forecast]().

## Forecast method: Build bottom up by channel **most common**

In many cases, a business will want granular control over various channels. By selecting "Build bottom up" you defer the forecast to the individual channels you have created.

Then, visit the [channels]() section to manage each.

In this case, the chart will show blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.
