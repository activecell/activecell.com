The cash analysis gives you a very important view into historical and future cash availability.

To ensure the accuracy of your data, be sure to categorize your asset accounts into Cash and Non-cash buckets. Only the asset accounts tagged as "Cash" will be reflected in this analysis.

## Historical cash

For months leading up to the current month, this analysis displays your company's total cash balance.

In the chart, historical cash balances are reflected by a darker shade of blue.

In the table, historical cash balances are greyed out.

## Future cash flows

To forecast future cash flows, Activecell simply applies your forecasted (or "pro forma") Profit & Loss figures to your current cash balance.

In the chart, historical cash balances are reflected by a lighter shade of blue.

## Cash "sensitivities"

Sensitivity analysis is used to determine the impact of changing simple variables on a final outcome. In this case, we make it easy to visualize how changes to the timing and amount of various cash flows will impact your final cash balance.

### How is cash impacted by changes in cash timing?

This is simple enough. What if you pay your vendors earlier or later? What if your customers pay you earlier or later? These sensitivities allow you to quickly see the cash impact of these changes so that you can determine if it makes sense to offer customers pre-payment benefits or tighten the screws on cash collection.

Naturally, we allow you to adjust the timing of each line item separately. Typically, companies pay employees with no delay, pay vendors with some delay, and receive cash with some delay.

### How is cash impacted by changes in P&L amounts?

This is simpler yet. How would cash be impacted if we reduced overheads by 10%? Would we have enough cash if we doubled our team size? These simple sensitivities are a lot faster than going in and editing the forecasts for each category in great detail. It makes for an easy place to do quick calculations.
