title: "Revenue forecast overview"

Activecell provides a variety of methods for building a revenue forecast for you business and comparing historical revenue to the plan.

When you visit the [revenue overview](), you can view total revenue compared to plan over time, and you can modify the methods by which the forecast is generated.

The point of providing these different methods is to ensure that companies that want a simple, 1-line forecast for revenue can have this, while companies that require a tremendous degree of granularity can have that just the same. Activecell is designed to mold to your business however you think about it.

## Forecast method: Exclude revenue from the plan

In some cases you may not wish to model revenue at all. These cases may include non-profits or startups that wish to strictly model expenditures for a time before getting into revenue planning.

Of course, this is fine with Activecell. Select "Exclude" to eliminate the revenue forecast entirely. Done and done.

In this case, the table and chart will only show actual data with no plan to compare against. Any actuals that show up in revenue accounts will show as a variance.

## Forecast method: Forecast manually: 1 line

It might be the case that you only really have one revenue stream or that revenue is so simple for your business that you don't want to get into building out a list of product groups or customer segments. If this is the case, you can select "Forecast manually" to build your revenue forecast in one line.

In such a case, you have a few extra tools at your disposal for getting a single-line forecast right. We call these "revenue drivers," and they are the same tools we use to model individual revenue streams, product groups, or customer segments.

### Revenue driver: Forecast manually

If there isn't a useful benchmark for planning revenue and you really just want a 1-line plan, no problem.

This means there will not be a revenue driver line in the chart, but you can still track plan vs actual.

### Revenue driver: Forecast bottom up by product volume

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark revenue against product sales (e.g. for every _x_ thousand units, customer acquisition should be _y_).

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve product volume from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for product volume must be managed manually. If you forecast revenue as 1 line, you will also need to forecast product volume as 1 line.

### Revenue driver: Forecast bottom up by customer volume

It is possible in Activecell to simply benchmark revenue against customer volume, presuming that as customer volume grows, so will your customer acquisition.

**Note:** For now Activecell cannot reliably retrieve customer volume from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for customer volume must be managed manually. If you forecast revenue as 1 line, you will also need to forecast customer volume as 1 line.

### Revenue driver: Forecast bottom up by team size

It is also possible in Activecell to simply benchmark your revenue forecast against team size, presuming that as your team grows, so will your revenue.

**Note:** For now, Activecell cannot reliably retrieve team size from QuickBooks or Xero, so both the plan and actual values for team size must be managed manually within the [employee type forecast]().

## Forecast method: Build bottom up by revenue stream

As a reminder, revenue streams are simply _groups of revenue accounts_ that you can define and manage.

By modeling revenue by revenue stream you lean on your revenue accounts primary and defer the forecast to the individual revenue streams you have created. You can visit the [revenue streams]() section to manage each.

<!-- screenshot -->

In this case, the chart will show blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.

## Forecast method: Build bottom up by product group

As a reminder, product groups are simply _groups of products_ that you can define and manage.

By modeling revenue by product group you lean on your product list primary and defer the forecast to the individual product groups you have created. You can visit the [product groups]() section to manage each.

<!-- screenshot -->

In this case, the chart will show blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.

## Forecast method: Build bottom up by customer segment

As a reminder, customer segments are simply _groups of customers_ that you can define and manage.

By modeling revenue by customer segment you lean on your customer list primary and defer the forecast to the individual customer segments you have created. You can visit the [customer segments]() section to manage each.

<!-- screenshot -->

In this case, the chart will show blue columns for actuals and either green or red columns for plan — green if actuals came in under plan and red if actuals came in over plan.
