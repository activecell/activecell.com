Activecell is designed so that you do not have to adjust your chart of accounts to facilitate planning. This is because often a company's accounts are set up in a way that facilitates tax preparation, commission models, or any number of other purposes.

Instead, we allow you to categorize your accounts into the various buckets we use for planning. We even take a first pass for you.

## Separating cash and non-cash asset accounts

If we are going to look at the cash impact of your plan, it is important to know which accounts to include in the cash calculation.

Visit the [account categorization page](http://launchpad.activecell.com/#settings/accounts) if you haven't already been directed to it. Then make sure you have selected "Assets" from the account type selector.

Your accounts will be grouped in the table into cash and non-cash buckets.

Above that, you will see the breakdown of cash and non-cash asset balances over time.

Correcting mis-categorized accounts is as simple as dragging the account from one bucket to the other by clicking and dragging the hand icon on the right.

### What are Cash accounts?

It is entirely up to you how strictly you wish to define "Cash" vs "Non-cash" accounts. This has no impact on accounting principles or any external reporting requirements. This is simply for your cash planning. Generally, we recommend tagging an account as "Cash" if you can use it to pay bills and payroll without an unreasonable penalty. Candidates include checking and savings accounts as well as short-term, liquid investments.

## Categorizing COGS and Expense accounts

With a similar approach, we are going to categorize expenses into Cost of Goods Sold, Team, Customer Acquisition, and Overheads.

First, select "Cost of Goods Sold" from the account type selector.

_Note:_ In some versions of QuickBooks, Cost of Goods Sold appear as a separate account type, and in some versions these accounts are lumped in with Expense accounts.

### What are Cost of Goods Sold accounts?

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) include of the direct costs associated with delivery goods or services to your customers. If you purchase goods for resale or raw materials or components for the goods you sell, these are COGS. If you incur service costs such as web hosting or have to purchase supporting goods such as shipping materials to deliver your product, these are COGS.

Traditionally, COGS would also incur the cost of direct labor, those people engaged directly in delivering services to your customers. However, we like to group all people costs under "Team" so that we can build a unified staffing plan. You can then assign a portion of your staffing plan to COGS, as we will explain in the [team forecast section](http://launchpad.activecell.com).

The process for categorizing COGS accounts is the same as with assets. Simply drag accounts from one category to another and observe your historical data change accordingly in the chart above.

Once complete, select "Expense" from the account type selector to categorize expense accounts.

### What are Team accounts?

It is entirely up to you how you want to plan for your team expenditures. This category should almost certainly include payroll accounts and other direct costs associated with compensating your employees. As a best practice, however, it can be useful to also include any expense accounts for contractors that do work similar to your internal employees. Each business is different, of course.

As we mentioned above, it can be useful to include direct labor costs in the "Team" bucket so that you can build a unified staffing plan.

Note: This categorization is simply for planning purposes. It does not have to do with distinctions between W2 and 1099 employees for accounting purposes. More every year, companies large and small are employing a mix of internal employees and external contractors. By lumping the two together for planning purposes, you can plan your total workforce at once.

While you might want to include accounts for contractors in this category, you would generally not include professional services such as legal and accounting services, as these more natural fall into "Overheads" below.

### What are Customer Acquisition accounts?

Customer acquisition costs include sales, marketing, and any other costs associated with acquiring new customers. Since payroll costs are captured under "Team," this bucket will only include the hard costs associated with your various customer acquisition channels.

### What are Overheads accounts?

Once you've taken out cost of goods sold, team costs, and customer acquisition costs, overheads and essentially everything else. Sometimes overheads are referred to as "General & Administrative" (G&A) costs.

These costs typically include professional services such as legal and accounting. They often include rent and other office expenses, including office supplies, meals & entertainment, and so forth.

## It's your business. Categorize accordingly!

Every business is different. If you only have 1 account that would be considered Cost of Goods Sold, you can always categorize it as an overhead expense and eliminate the COGS line item from your plan entirely.

Or, if you have your team costs split up meticulously into direct labor accounts, salesperson accounts, and overheads accounts, you can always map those accordingly and eliminate that "team" line item from your plan.

It's your business, and we just want to give you the tools to customize Activecell to your business in as useful a way as possible.
