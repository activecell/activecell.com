At Activecell, there is nothing we like more than happy customers. Fact.

For us, there is no greater sign of a happy customer than when our customers encourage their friends to sign up. We love this so much, in fact, that we want to reward you for telling your friends.

### Saving on your bill

The minute you have an Activecell account, we create a code and a link that you can use to send your friends our way.

**For each user who subscribes to a paid account, you get 10% off your bill.**

It's that easy.

### Generating recurring revenue

Even better, once your bill is paid for, we start *paying you* for each future referral. (!!!)

This can be a very powerful way for you to build recurring revenue into your service model.

* 10% revenue share for your first 10 companies
* 20% revenue share for your next 20 companies
* 30% revenue share for your next 30 companies
* 40% revenue share for your next 40 companies
* 50% revenue share for the rest

You have read this correctly. Once 100 companies have signed up using your referral link, you get a 50% revenue share for all future companies. This provides a very lucrative means of generating ongoing, recurring revenue for yourself or your company.

_Note:_ The company count refers to **active** companies.

## How it works

### Our advisor program

Our advisor program counts as part of the ambassador program. Whether you pay your clients bills or not, if you ensure they sign up with your link, they count. (If they don't show up in your ambassador list, just contact us!)

See [this article]() for more information about the advisor program.
