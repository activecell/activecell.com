Once you have created an Activecell account, it is easy to invite as many users as you like. You can invite employees, investors, your accountant, your bookkeeper, a virtual CFOâ€¦you name it.

The process is managed with the Access Control panel of your settings.

## Inviting existing users

If the person you invite to your company is already an Activecell user, the process could not be simpler. When you invite the user, we will add the user to your company straight away, and the user will receive an email letting them know this has happened.

## Inviting advisors

If the person you invite is part of an advisor company (see [this article]() for more information), you will be asked whether to invite them individually or invite their company.

Inviting a user's company means that any user from their company will have access to your company. Sometimes you may want this, sometimes not. If not, just invite the user as an individual.

## Inviting new users

If the person you invite is not an existing Activecell user, we will send the user an email asking them to sign up.

Once the new user signs up, we will direct the user to your company straight away.
