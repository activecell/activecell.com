## QuickBooks connection

If you have already connected Activecell to QuickBooks, this panel will allow you to disconnect. It is your data, so of course you can disconnect at any time, but for security reasons, disconnecting will also trigger the deletion of your data from our servers, so proceed with caution!

Of course, once you disconnect, you can always reconnect as easily as when you got started originally. For help on this process, please see:

* Connecting QuickBooks Desktop
* Connecting QuickBooks Online

## QuickBooks data sync

Once data is connected, this panel provides information on data sync status.

If you use QuickBooks Desktop, it will display the status of your most recent sync from your local desktop software to Intuit's cloud services.

Then, regardless of which accounting platform you use, you will see the status of your data sync to Activecell.

We try to keep your data as up to date as possible, but if you just updated your source accounting data, you can always initiate a sync manually and track its progress.

## Categorizing your accounts

When your accounting data is in sync with Activecell, you can categorize your accounts to improve the quality of your forecast. For step by step guidance, please see:

* Categorize your accounts

## Activecell account

If you are in a free trial, this panel will let you know how many days remain in your trial.

At any time in your trial, you can provide credit card details to upgrade to an Activecell plan.

Once in a plan, you can always cancel your account at any time or switch between monthly and annual plans.

## Access control

The access control page provides all the functionality needed to manage:

1. The companies to which you have access as a user
1. The users who have access to your company
1. Upgrading your company to "advisor" status so that your company can access its clients

For step by step guidance, please see:

* Inviting users
* The advisor program

## The Ambassador program

The Ambassador program is designed to save you money on your Activecell bill if you refer friends to us and they become Activecell users.

It's a great program not only for saving money on Activecell, but if you end up becoming an active referrer, you have the opportunity to share in the revenue of the users you bring onto the platform. It's a fantastic program for affiliates who have broad audiences they reach.
