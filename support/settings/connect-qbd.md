Intuit offers a single-sign-on (SSO) experience so that being logged into their platform means being logged into Activecell. It's a great convenience, particularly if you use multiple applications that integrate with QuickBooks.

If you are just getting started and wish to create your account using Intuit's Single Sign on, please see [this article]() to get started.

If, however, you have already created an account or been invited to a new account, it is possible to connect to your data from within Activecell.

## Connecting

If you haven't connected your data, Activecell will automatically direct you to do so.

Simply click "Connect to QB" to begin.

If you are not already signed into your Intuit account, you will be asked to sign in:

_Note: If you do not yet have an Intuit account, you can create one in minutes by clicking "Create an account."_

## Authorizing your company

Once signed in, if you do not yet have an Activecell account, you will be asked to connect to your QuickBooks data. It is during this step that you select which company's data to use. This is particularly important if you have multiple QuickBooks companies associated with your account.

## Desktop to Intuit sync

As a QuickBooks Desktop user, your information resides in a file on your computer. In order to sync it with cloud services, Intuit provides a Sync Manager utility, which is a free, downloadable utility that will manage secure, ongoing sync between your local file and their cloud services.

For more information on Sync Manager, please see [this article]() on Intuit's support site.

To help avoid breakdowns in the process, Activecell provides helpful information about the status of this sync.

### If you have never synced locally

If we see that you have never synced data between your local desktop file and Intuit's cloud service, we will provide the following alert:

In this case, you should check to make sure your data is synced properly, and we are happy to help through our support process if you run into trouble.

### If you have synced locally

If you have synced your data in the past, we provide information on your last sync. This is useful in the case where your bookkeeper just did this month's books, and you aren't seeing the data in Activecell. You can check to see if the data was synced from your local file to Intuit. If not, you can always make sure that sync takes place before syncing Activecell's data.

## Intuit to Activecell sync

Once you have a live sync occurring between your desktop and Intuit, you can ensure that Activecell is up to date, as well.

From here, you can view the most recent sync, initiate a new sync, and even view the history of recent syncs.
