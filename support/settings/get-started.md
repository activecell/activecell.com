We try to make getting started with Activecell as quick and easy as possible.

Here's what it looks like:

<!-- screenshot -->

1. Sign up
2. Connect your data
3. Allow the data to sync up
4. Categorize your accounts

From the start, we also give you the option of saving money on your Activecell bill by recommending us to friends. We call that the "Ambassador program".

## Signing up

If you use QuickBooks, you can sign up directly using your Intuit account. If you don't use QuickBooks you can sign up by creating a username and password for Activecell.

For step by step guidance, please see:

* Getting started with Intuit
* Getting started with Xero

These guides will step through creating an account, connecting, and syncing data.

## Categorizing your accounts

Once your data is synced, you will have the opportunity to categorize your accounts to improve the quality of your forecast. A quick first pass is smart, but it is not necessary to get everything 100% because you can always update the mappings later on.

For step by step guidance, please see:

* Categorize your accounts

## The Ambassador program

The Ambassador program is designed to save you money on your Activecell bill if you refer friends to us and they become Activecell users.

It's a great program not only for saving money on Activecell, but if you end up becoming an active referrer, you have the opportunity to share in the revenue of the users you bring onto the platform. It's a fantastic program for affiliates who have broad audiences they reach.
