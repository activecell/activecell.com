Intuit offers a single-sign-on (SSO) experience so that being logged into their platform means being logged into Activecell. It's a great convenience, particularly if you use multiple applications that integrate with QuickBooks.

If you are just getting started and wish to create your account using Intuit's Single Sign on, please see [this article]() to get started.

If, however, you have already created an account or been invited to a new account, it is possible to connect to your data from within Activecell.

## Connecting

If you haven't connected your data, Activecell will automatically direct you to do so.

Simply click "Connect to QB" to begin.

If you are not already signed into your Intuit account, you will be asked to sign in:

_Note: If you do not yet have an Intuit account, you can create one in minutes by clicking "Create an account."_

## Authorizing your company

Once signed in, if you do not yet have an Activecell account, you will be asked to connect to your QuickBooks data. It is during this step that you select which company's data to use. This is particularly important if you have multiple QuickBooks companies associated with your account.

## Data sync

Once you have connected to QuickBooks Online, we provide information about how the data is synced. If you have synced your data in the past, we provide information on your last sync. This is useful in the case where your bookkeeper just did this month's books, and you aren't seeing the data in Activecell.

From here, you can view the most recent sync, initiate a new sync, and even view the history of recent syncs.
