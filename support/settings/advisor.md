Activecell is built with advisors in mind. We include accountants, bookkeepers, CFOs, small business consultants, and others in this group. They share a need to engage with their client base on an ongoing basis.

Activecell provides content to start a new conversation, information to track on a rolling basis, a way to drive deeper engagement with your client base.

## The advisor model vs normal users

Without the advisor model, it is possible for business owners to invite as many users as they like. Naturally, they can invite their accountant, their bookkeeper, investors, employees, etc.

This model involves 1 company with 1 or more users. Each user has access to the company unless the business owner de-activates them.

An advisor company, similarly, involves 1 company with 1 or more users. These users are the members of the advisory company.

Then, when the advisor creates a company or gets invited to a company, all users from the advisor company have access to the child company. This makes access simpler and avoids the need to invite multiple users from an advisor company to each advised company.

## Upgrading to advisor

If you use Activecell for your own company, you can upgrade to advisor at any time from your Account settings.

If you do not use Activecell for your own company, you can create a company from scratch and upgrade before connecting data. See [this article]() for more information.

## Managing your companies

Once you have upgraded to advisor, you will have access to an advisor panel in your settings.

From here, you may add companies as simply as clicking "Add a new company." The only thing you will need is a company name and a subdomain where their account can be accessed.

Once a company is added, you may log onto that company by clicking "Log on" from settings, or by selecting the company from your user menu at the top of the page.

From settings, you may also remove a company. If you are the company's only user, this will remove the company entirely. If the company has other users, the company will remain for them, simply revoking your company's access.

### Overriding billing

Many advisors prefer to include Activecell as a part of their services, baking the costs into their fees.

This is particularly useful, because advisors get volume discounts and often pay much less than their clients would pay individually.

To override billing for your clients, simply click "override billing," and your client's Activecell fees will appear on your bill.

## Your clients can invite you

To add existing companies to your advisor company, you may simply ask them to invite you. If your email address is associated with an advisor company, they will be prompted whether to invite you as an individual or to invite your company as an advisor.

Within each company, the list of users will include individuals and advisory companies, each marked accordingly.

If you have overridden billing for your clients, they will not see the account panel within settings.
